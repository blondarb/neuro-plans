## Description

Neuro Plans is a comprehensive clinical decision support tool for neurology, built by neurologists for neurologists, APPs, residents, and medical students.

166 EVIDENCE-BASED CLINICAL PLANS
Browse structured treatment protocols covering the full spectrum of neurological diagnoses — from acute ischemic stroke and status epilepticus to multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and peripheral neuropathy. Every plan includes:

 - Laboratory workup with CPT codes and priority levels
 - Diagnostic imaging and studies
 - Medication dosing and treatment algorithms
 - Monitoring parameters and disposition criteria
 - Differential diagnosis checklists
 - Evidence tables with PubMed-linked citations

ORGANIZED BY CARE SETTING
Each plan adapts to your clinical environment. Toggle between ED, Hospital, Outpatient, and ICU views to see setting-appropriate priorities — STAT items in the emergency department, ROUTINE in outpatient, and everything in between.

INTERACTIVE PLAN BUILDER
Select individual lab tests, imaging studies, and treatments from any plan to build a custom order set. Copy your selections to the clipboard and paste directly into your EMR.

CLINICAL SCALES AND EXAM TOOLS
NIHSS, Glasgow Coma Scale, modified Rankin Scale, and other validated scoring instruments with interactive calculation.

ALWAYS CURRENT
Plans reference the latest guidelines (AHA/ASA 2026 Stroke Guidelines, AAN Practice Parameters, IDSA Guidelines) with direct PubMed links to primary sources.

FREE 14-DAY TRIAL
Try every feature free for 14 days. Then continue with an annual subscription for ongoing access.
