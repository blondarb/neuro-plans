   - Any special instructions

5. Click "Submit for Review"

**Review typically takes 24-48 hours.**

---

### 7.3 Common Rejection Reasons & Fixes

#### Guideline 3.1.1 — Subscription Disclosure (HIGH RISK)

Apple requires **all** of the following near the purchase button:

- [ ] Subscription price pulled from StoreKit (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Subscription period pulled from StoreKit (not hardcoded "/year")
- [ ] Explicit auto-renewal statement with price and period
- [ ] Cancellation instructions ("Settings > Apple ID > Subscriptions")
- [ ] Working "Restore Purchases" button (labeled clearly)
- [ ] Working links to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
- [ ] Links must NOT force-unwrap: use `if let url = URL(...)` not `URL(...)!`

**Example disclosure text (must include actual price from StoreKit):**
> Payment of $12.99 will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews at $12.99/year unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your device's Settings > Apple ID > Subscriptions.

**Common mistake:** Advertising a free trial in the App Store description or paywall UI when the introductory offer is NOT configured in App Store Connect. If you advertise "14-day free trial," the StoreKit product must have a matching introductory offer.

#### Guideline 4.3 — Spam / Duplicate Apps (HIGH RISK for multi-specialty)

If you publish multiple apps from the same template (e.g., Neuro Plans + Cardio Plans), Apple will reject both unless they are "sufficiently different." Each app must have:

- [ ] Different app icon and brand color
- [ ] Different header icon on disclaimer and paywall screens
- [ ] Different tagline and about description
- [ ] Different paywall feature list (mentions specialty-specific content)
- [ ] Different quick actions on home screen
- [ ] Different exam tools (specialty-specific, not shared)
- [ ] Different clinical scales and calculators
- [ ] Different categories and plan content
- [ ] Separate support email and legal documents
- [ ] Unique App Store screenshots showing specialty content
- [ ] App Review notes that explain the specialty focus

**All differentiation is driven through `SpecialtyConfig.swift`.** See `APP_STORE_DIFFERENTIATION.md` for the full strategy.

#### Guideline 5.1.1 — Privacy (MEDIUM RISK)

- [ ] `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` declares ALL accessed APIs and collected data types
- [ ] Privacy policy URL is live and accessible (test from a fresh browser)
- [ ] If using Supabase or any third-party backend, disclose it in privacy policy
- [ ] App Store Connect "App Privacy" section matches PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy

**Data types to declare in PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy:**
- `NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryUserDefaults` (for preferences, trial date, etc.)
- `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeEmailAddress` (if email verification is used)
- `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypePurchaseHistory` (StoreKit subscription data)
- `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeDeviceID` (if device ID is generated for plan requests)

#### Guideline 4.2 — Minimum Functionality (LOW RISK)

App must provide native value beyond a web wrapper. Our apps include:
- Interactive clinical scales with scoring
- Exam tools with hardware integration (camera flash, gyroscope)
- Plan Builder with export
- Clinical calculators

#### Guideline 2.1 — Crashes (LOW RISK)

- [ ] No `fatalError()` calls in production code
- [ ] No force-unwraps (`!`) on values that could be nil at runtime
- [ ] No `print()` statements in production — use `os_log` / `Logger`
- [ ] Test on device (not just simulator) before submission
- [ ] Check Xcode Organizer for crash logs after TestFlight

---

### 7.4 Pre-Submission Checklist

Run this checklist **every time** before submitting any specialty app:

#### Code Quality
- [ ] Zero `fatalError()` calls (search entire project)
- [ ] Zero `print()` calls (use `Logger` from OSLog)
- [ ] No force-unwrapped URLs: `URL(string:)!` → `if let url = URL(string:)`
- [ ] All strings in PaywallView, SettingsView, DisclaimerView read from `SpecialtyConfig`
- [ ] `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` declares all APIs and data types

#### Subscription Compliance (Guideline 3.1.1)
- [ ] Price displayed from `product.displayPrice` (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Period displayed from `subscription.subscriptionPeriod(for:)` (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Auto-renewal disclosure includes price, period, and cancellation path
- [ ] "Restore Purchases" button visible and labeled
- [ ] Terms of Service link works
- [ ] Privacy Policy link works
- [ ] Manage Subscription link available for subscribed users
- [ ] Revoked/refunded transactions handled (`transaction.revocationDate` check)

#### App Store Connect
- [ ] Agreements, Tax, and Banking completed (status: "Active")
- [ ] Introductory offer configured (if trial is advertised)
- [ ] Sandbox tester created and tested
- [ ] App Privacy section published (not just configured)
- [ ] Screenshots uploaded for all required device sizes
- [ ] App Review notes explain subscription flow

#### Multi-Specialty (Guideline 4.3)
- [ ] Run `APP_STORE_DIFFERENTIATION.md` checklist
- [ ] Support email is unique per app (not shared)
- [ ] Legal docs reference correct app name and email
- [ ] App Store screenshots show specialty-specific content
- [ ] Review notes explain how this app differs from others

---

### 7.5 New Specialty App Setup

When cloning the codebase for a new specialty (e.g., Cardio Plans, Pulm Plans):

1. **Change ALL values in `SpecialtyConfig.swift`** — not just identity:
   - `appName`, `specialty`, `bundleId`
   - `brandColorHex`, `headerIcon`, `tagline`
   - `storeKitProductId`
   - `errorReportEmail`, `supportEmail`
   - `supabaseUrl`, `supabaseAnonKey` (create separate Supabase project)
   - `termsURL`, `privacyURL`, `disclaimerTitle`
   - `paywallFeatures` (specialty-specific feature descriptions)
   - `aboutDescription`, `aboutIcon`
   - `quickActions` (specialty-specific emergency protocols)

2. **Replace content files:**
   - `Category.swift` — new categories and plan IDs
   - `Reference.swift` — new scales, exams, and tools
   - `CalculatorEngine.swift` — add specialty-specific calculators
   - `ExamToolsView.swift` — replace exam tool enum with specialty tools
   - `plans.json` — new clinical plan data
   - `scales.json`, `exams.json`, `tools.json` — new reference data

3. **Create legal pages:**
   - Privacy policy at new domain (not shared with other apps)
   - Terms of service at new domain
   - Unique support email

4. **App Store Connect:**
   - Create separate app record
   - Create new subscription group and product
   - Upload unique screenshots
   - Write unique description and keywords

5. **Run the Pre-Submission Checklist (Section 7.4)**

---

## Phase 8: Post-Launch

### 8.1 Monitor & Respond

- Check App Store Connect daily for reviews
- Respond to user feedback
- Monitor crash reports in Xcode Organizer
- Check error report emails

### 8.2 Updates

For updates:
1. Increment Build number
2. Archive and upload
3. Submit for review
4. Updates typically review faster

**Rejection reasons (inferred from code audit):**
- Guideline 3.1.1 — Subscription disclosure issues (hardcoded price/period, missing legal text)
- Guideline 4.3 — Neuro Plans and Cardio Plans too similar (same UI, same text)
- Guideline 5.1.1 — Privacy manifest incomplete (missing data type declarations)

### Version 1.0 — Submission 2 (Pending)

**Status: CODE FIXES COMPLETE — Waiting for App Store Connect updates**

#### Code fixes applied (branch: `claude/investigate-app-store-rejection-SDB7O`)

| Commit | Fix | Guideline |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| `965ca41` | Differentiation framework — SpecialtyConfig expansion, config-driven views, quick actions bar | 4.3 |
| `6c6cab4` | Subscription disclosures — StoreKit-driven pricing, legal text, revocation handling | 3.1.1 |
| `093603c` | Privacy manifest — added data type declarations, replaced debug prints with OSLog | 5.1.1, 2.1 |
| `f149d91` | Free trial in StoreKit config, 9 hardcoded strings → config-driven, safe URL init, review notes | 3.1.1, 4.3 |

#### Still required in App Store Connect (manual):

- [ ] **Update App Privacy section** — change from "Data Not Collected" to declare: Email Address, Purchase History, Device ID (all: Not Linked, Not Tracking, App Functionality)
- [ ] **Click "Publish" on App Privacy** after updating
- [ ] **Configure introductory offer** — 14-day free trial on the annual subscription
- [ ] **Complete Agreements, Tax, and Banking** (required for subscription payments)
- [ ] **Create sandbox tester** and test full purchase flow on device
- [ ] **Update review notes** in App Store Connect (copy from APP_STORE_METADATA.md Section "Review Notes")
- [ ] **Re-archive and upload** new build (version 1.0.0, build 2)
- [ ] **Verify legal URLs load** — neuroplans.app/privacy/ and neuroplans.app/terms/
- [ ] Submit for review

#### Pre-submission validation

Run `ios/scripts/ios-preflight.sh` before every submission to catch common rejection risks automatically.

### Key Learnings

1. **iPad screenshots are required** if `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = "1,2"` (iPhone + iPad). Set to `"1"` if iPhone-only.
2. **App Privacy must be explicitly Published** -- configuring responses is not enough; you must click "Publish."
3. **Subscription group localization is required** -- even for English.
4. **Screenshot uploads require manual interaction** -- browser security blocks programmatic file input.
5. **xcodebuild can archive and export from CLI** -- no Xcode GUI needed.
6. **Export compliance "No" for HTTPS-only apps** -- standard exemption.
7. **Never hardcode subscription price or period** -- always read from StoreKit `Product` object.
8. **"Data Not Collected" is wrong** if you use Supabase email verification, StoreKit, or device IDs.
9. **Multi-specialty apps need aggressive differentiation** -- different icons, colors, features, content, and legal docs. Use `SpecialtyConfig.swift` for everything.
10. **All user-visible strings must be config-driven** -- grep for hardcoded app name before submission.
11. **Force-unwrapped URLs are a crash risk** -- use `guard let` or `if let` for all URL(string:) calls.
12. **Remove all print() before submission** -- use `Logger` from `OSLog` instead.
