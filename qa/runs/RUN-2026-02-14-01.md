## Mission Brief

**Changes:**
- Fixed 14 wrong PubMed citations across 5 plan files (da17b20)
- Fixed overly broad frontmatter tags on 10 plan files (17f24cb)
- Fixed parity checker: added missing table header keywords (66ae695)
- Added RepGenius privacy policy page to mkdocs nav (0e41ba5)
- Fixed iOS Xcode project: added 13 missing Swift files + Supabase SPM dependency (local only, not pushed)

**Test scope:**
- Smoke: SMK-01 through SMK-07 on live site (neuroplans.app)
- Clinical tool regression: setting switching, checkbox, sidebar, tooltips, clear, diagnosis switch
- PubMed link spot-check on 5 fixed plans
- Mobile viewport (375px)
- iOS app build, launch, and visual inspection in iPhone 17 Pro Simulator (iOS 26.2)
- iOS accessibility tests: dark mode, large text, high contrast

## Results

| ID | Result | Notes |
|----|--------|-------|
| SMK-01 | PASS | Homepage loads, teal nav, hero shows "147 Approved Plans" |
| SMK-02 | PASS | Plans index loads with ~19 category tables |
| SMK-03 | PASS | Clinical Plan Builder loads: dropdown, care setting buttons, priority badges, icon legend, sidebar |
| SMK-04 | PASS | Plan data renders: migraine + ED selected, 4 sections populated (Labs, Imaging, Treatment, Other Recs) |
| SMK-05 | PASS | 3 plans navigated (Acute Ischemic Stroke, Migraine, Peripheral Neuropathy) — all 8 sections render |
| SMK-06 | PASS | 375px viewport: hamburger nav works, content scrollable, no overflow |
| SMK-07 | PASS | Search: typed "migraine", got "86 matching documents" with highlighted results |
| CT-01 | PASS | Checkbox selection: 3 items checked (CBC, CMP, hCG), sidebar shows count badge "3" and item list |
| CT-02 | PASS | Setting switch ED→Hospital: priority badges update (URGENT→ROUTINE), item set adapts |
| CT-03 | PASS | Setting switch Hospital→Outpatient: all items show ROUTINE, correct for outpatient context |
| CT-04 | PASS | Tooltip (info icon): shows "RATIONALE: Rule out anemia, infection" on CBC |
| CT-05 | PASS | Tooltip (target icon): shows "TARGET: Normal" on CBC |
| CT-06 | SKIP | Copy to Clipboard: button present and clickable; clipboard API requires user-initiated click (extension limitation) |
| CT-07 | PASS | Clear Selection: all checkboxes unchecked, sidebar shows "0 / No items selected" |
| CT-08 | PASS | Diagnosis switch: migraine→acute-ischemic-stroke, plan fully re-renders with different labs |
| PMID-01 | PASS | Acute Ischemic Stroke: AHA/ASA link → PMID 41582814 (Prabhakaran et al. Stroke 2026) ✓ |
| PMID-02 | PASS | Status Epilepticus: ESETT link → PMID 31774955 (Kapur et al. NEJM 2019) ✓ |
| PMID-03 | PASS | GBS: 10 PubMed links verified (Dutch GBS 1992, Cochrane 2014, French Cooperative 1987, etc.) |
| PMID-04 | PASS | Myasthenic Crisis: 13 PubMed links verified (MGTX, REGAIN, ADAPT trials, etc.) |
| PMID-05 | PASS | Bacterial Meningitis: 8 PubMed links verified (IDSA 2004, de Gans NEJM 2002, etc.) |
| iOS-01 | PASS | Xcode build succeeds (iPhone 17 Pro, iOS 26.2) after adding 13 files + Supabase SPM |
| iOS-02 | PASS | App launches, disclaimer screen displays correctly |
| iOS-03 | PASS | Home screen: "Good afternoon", search bar, setting tabs (ED/HOSP/OPD/ICU), 166 plans, 8+ categories |
| iOS-04 | PASS | Dark mode: proper dark background, readable text, functional tab bar |
| iOS-05 | PASS | Large text (extra-large): layout adapts, no clipping, fully usable |
| iOS-06 | PASS | Accessibility-large text: labels wrap, UI still functional (tight but usable) |
| iOS-07 | PASS | High contrast mode: bolder borders, proper separation, fully functional |
| iOS-08 | PASS | iOS/web data parity: 166 plans each, MD5 identical |

## Notes

- CT-06 (Copy to Clipboard) was SKIPPED because the browser extension's simulated click doesn't trigger the Clipboard API (requires a genuine user-initiated event). The button is present and visually correct; manual verification recommended.
- Homepage hero shows "147 Approved Plans" but total plan count is 166. This is expected — some plans are in draft status and the hero metric only counts approved ones.
- iOS UI interaction tests (tapping through views, plan detail, builder) could not be automated via simctl. Visual inspection via screenshots confirmed home screen, dark mode, and accessibility modes render correctly. Manual testing of navigation and detail views recommended before App Store submission.
- Xcode project.pbxproj changes (13 added Swift files + Supabase SPM) are local only — need to be committed.
