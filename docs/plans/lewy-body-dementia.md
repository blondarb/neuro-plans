## APPENDIX A: McKeith Criteria for DLB (2017)

### Essential Feature (Required)
- Dementia defined as progressive cognitive decline sufficient to interfere with normal social or occupational function

### Core Clinical Features
1. **Fluctuating cognition** with pronounced variations in attention and alertness
2. **Recurrent visual hallucinations** that are typically well-formed and detailed
3. **REM sleep behavior disorder** (may precede cognitive decline)
4. **One or more spontaneous cardinal features of parkinsonism:** bradykinesia, rest tremor, rigidity

### Indicative Biomarkers
1. **Reduced dopamine transporter uptake** in basal ganglia (DaTscan)
2. **Low uptake on cardiac MIBG scintigraphy**
3. **Polysomnographic confirmation of REM sleep without atonia**

### Supportive Biomarkers
1. Relative preservation of medial temporal lobe structures on CT/MRI
2. Generalized low uptake on SPECT/PET perfusion/metabolism scan with reduced occipital activity +/- cingulate island sign on FDG-PET
3. Prominent posterior slow-wave activity on EEG with periodic fluctuations

### Supportive Clinical Features
- Severe sensitivity to antipsychotic agents
- Postural instability and repeated falls
- Syncope or other transient episodes of unresponsiveness
- Severe autonomic dysfunction (constipation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence)
- Hypersomnia
- Hyposmia
- Hallucinations in other modalities
- Systematized delusions
- Apathy, anxiety, and depression

### Diagnostic Categories

**Probable DLB:**
- 2+ core clinical features with or without indicative biomarkers, OR
- 1 core clinical feature + 1+ indicative biomarkers

**Possible DLB:**
- 1 core clinical feature with no indicative biomarker, OR
- 1+ indicative biomarker but no core clinical features

### DLB vs PDD
- If dementia occurs before or within 1 year of parkinsonism onset → DLB
- If dementia occurs >1 year after established parkinsonism → PDD
- Both are considered part of the Lewy body disease spectrum

## APPENDIX B: Medications to AVOID in Lewy Body Dementia

| Drug Class | Examples | Why to Avoid |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Typical antipsychotics** | Haloperidol, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine | ABSOLUTE CONTRAINDICATION - severe parkinsonism, NMS, death |
| **Most atypical antipsychotics** | Risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone | High D2 blockade; 2-3x mortality risk; severe parkinsonism |
| **Antiemetics (D2 blockers)** | Metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, promethazine | Cross BBB; worsen parkinsonism; neuroleptic sensitivity |
| **Anticholinergics** | Benztropine, trihexyphenidyl, diphenhydramine, oxybutynin | Worsen cognitive impairment; increase confusion |
| **Sedating antihistamines** | Diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, doxylamine | Anticholinergic effects; worsen cognition |
| **Sleep aids with anticholinergics** | Tylenol PM, ZzzQuil | Contains diphenhydramine; contraindicated |

### Safe Alternatives

| Indication | Safe Options |
|------------|--------------|
| **Psychosis/agitation** | Quetiapine (lowest effective dose), pimavanserin |
