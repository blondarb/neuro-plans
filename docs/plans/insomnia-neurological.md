# Insomnia — Neurological Approach

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** February 7, 2026
**REVISED:** February 7, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Insomnia — Neurological Approach

**ICD-10:** G47.00 (Insomnia, unspecified), G47.01 (Insomnia due to medical condition), F51.01 (Primary insomnia)

**CPT CODES:** 95810 (Polysomnography (PSG)), 95803 (Actigraphy), 85025 (CBC), 80053 (CMP), 84443 (TSH), 82728 (Serum ferritin), 82533 (Cortisol), 96132 (Neurocognitive testing), 80307 (Urine drug screen), 82607 (Vitamin B12), 82746 (Folic acid), 84402 (Testosterone, free), 83036 (HbA1c), 86140 (CRP), 85652 (ESR), 95819 (EEG awake and sleep), 70553 (MRI brain with and without contrast)

**SYNONYMS:** Insomnia, chronic insomnia, sleep onset insomnia, sleep maintenance insomnia, terminal insomnia, early morning awakening, neurological insomnia, comorbid insomnia, psychophysiological insomnia, conditioned insomnia, paradoxical insomnia, insomnia disorder, sleep-onset difficulty, nonrestorative sleep

**SCOPE:** Neurological evaluation and management of insomnia in adults with neurological conditions. Focuses on insomnia comorbid with TBI, dementia, MS, Parkinson's disease, chronic pain, epilepsy, and stroke. Covers CBT-I as first-line, pharmacotherapy selection considering neurological comorbidities, and identification of secondary causes. Excludes primary psychiatric insomnia management (though addresses overlap), circadian rhythm disorders as primary diagnosis, and pediatric insomnia.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Insomnia Disorder:** Dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality associated with difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or early morning awakening, occurring at least 3 nights per week for at least 3 months, causing clinically significant distress or functional impairment, and not better explained by another sleep-wake disorder
- **Chronic Insomnia:** Insomnia symptoms persisting for 3 months or longer; previously termed "primary insomnia" when no identifiable comorbidity was present
- **Sleep Onset Insomnia:** Difficulty falling asleep at the beginning of the sleep period; sleep onset latency >30 minutes in adults
- **Sleep Maintenance Insomnia:** Difficulty staying asleep with prolonged awakenings during the night; wake after sleep onset (WASO) >30 minutes
- **Terminal Insomnia (Early Morning Awakening):** Waking earlier than desired with inability to return to sleep; often associated with depression and neurodegenerative disease
- **Comorbid Insomnia:** Insomnia occurring in the context of another medical, neurological, or psychiatric condition; the current preferred terminology over "secondary insomnia"
- **Psychophysiological Insomnia:** Conditioned arousal and learned sleep-preventing associations; the patient becomes anxious about not sleeping, which perpetuates the insomnia
- **Sleep Efficiency:** Ratio of total sleep time to time spent in bed, expressed as a percentage; normal >85%
- **Insomnia Severity Index (ISI):** Validated 7-item self-report measure; scores 0-7 (no insomnia), 8-14 (subthreshold), 15-21 (moderate), 22-28 (severe)

---

**DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (ICSD-3-TR / DSM-5-TR):**

**Insomnia Disorder — All of the following:**

1. The patient reports, or the patient's parent or caregiver observes, one or more of the following:
    - Difficulty initiating sleep
    - Difficulty maintaining sleep
    - Waking up earlier than desired
    - Resistance to going to bed on appropriate schedule
    - Difficulty sleeping without parent or caregiver intervention
2. The patient reports, or the patient's parent or caregiver observes, one or more of the following related to the nighttime sleep difficulty:
    - Fatigue/malaise
    - Attention, concentration, or memory impairment
    - Impaired social, family, vocational, or academic performance
    - Mood disturbance/irritability
    - Daytime sleepiness
    - Behavioral problems (hyperactivity, impulsivity, aggression)
    - Reduced motivation/energy/initiative
    - Proneness for errors/accidents
    - Concerns about or dissatisfaction with sleep
3. The reported sleep/wake complaints cannot be explained purely by inadequate opportunity or circumstances for sleep
4. The sleep disturbance and associated daytime symptoms occur at least 3 times per week
5. The sleep disturbance and associated daytime symptoms have been present for at least 3 months
6. The sleep/wake difficulty is not better explained by another sleep disorder

**Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) Interpretation:**
- No clinically significant insomnia: 0-7

- Moderate insomnia: 15-21
- Severe insomnia: 22-28

**Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Interpretation:**

## 4. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS

### 4A. Referrals & Consults

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Sleep medicine specialist for formal insomnia assessment, PSG if comorbid sleep disorder suspected, and CBT-I program coordination | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Psychology or psychiatry referral for CBT-I delivery; behavioral sleep medicine specialist preferred; digital CBT-I (Somryst/Pear Therapeutics) as alternative when in-person not available | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Neurology follow-up for underlying neurological condition management (TBI, dementia, MS, Parkinson's, epilepsy, stroke) as insomnia treatment is more effective when comorbid conditions are optimized | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Psychiatry referral if significant comorbid depression, anxiety, or PTSD contributing to insomnia; concurrent treatment improves outcomes for both conditions | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Pain management referral if chronic pain is primary driver of sleep disruption; multimodal pain management improves sleep outcomes | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Physical/occupational therapy for TBI or stroke patients with insomnia to address activity level, daytime structure, and functional recovery | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4B. Patient/Family Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Insomnia is a treatable condition; behavioral interventions (CBT-I) are more effective than medications long-term and should be pursued as first-line therapy | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Maintain a consistent sleep-wake schedule 7 days per week including weekends; irregular schedules worsen insomnia by disrupting circadian rhythm | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Keep a daily sleep diary recording bedtime, estimated sleep onset time, number and duration of nighttime awakenings, final wake time, and subjective sleep quality; bring to all appointments | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Take sleep medications at the time prescribed and allow adequate time for sleep (at least 7 hours for most medications) to avoid next-day impairment | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Do not increase medication doses without physician guidance; do not combine multiple sleep medications or add alcohol to aid sleep | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Seek urgent care if insomnia is accompanied by hallucinations, severe confusion, new neurological symptoms (weakness, numbness, speech difficulty), or suicidal thoughts | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid screen use (phone, tablet, computer, TV) for at least 30-60 minutes before bedtime as blue light suppresses melatonin and stimulating content increases arousal | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| If you cannot fall asleep within 20 minutes, get out of bed and do a quiet, non-stimulating activity in dim light until you feel sleepy, then return to bed (stimulus control) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Regular moderate exercise (30 minutes daily, 5 days/week) improves sleep quality; avoid vigorous exercise within 4 hours of bedtime as it may increase arousal | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Morning bright light exposure (30 minutes within 1 hour of waking) helps entrain circadian rhythm and improve sleep onset; especially important in dementia and TBI patients | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Caffeine cutoff by noon; caffeine half-life is 5-7 hours and even afternoon consumption significantly impairs sleep onset and reduces total sleep time | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid alcohol as a sleep aid; although it promotes initial sleep onset, alcohol fragments sleep architecture, reduces REM sleep, and worsens insomnia in the second half of the night | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Maintain cool bedroom temperature (65-68 degrees F); core body temperature drop facilitates sleep onset | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Stress management techniques including progressive muscle relaxation, diaphragmatic breathing, and mindfulness meditation can reduce physiological hyperarousal that perpetuates insomnia | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Weight management as obesity is associated with OSA, which commonly coexists with and exacerbates insomnia | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Limit daytime naps to 20 minutes maximum before 3:00 PM; longer or later naps reduce homeostatic sleep drive and worsen nighttime insomnia | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Disposition | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Outpatient management | Vast majority of insomnia patients; uncomplicated insomnia for CBT-I and/or pharmacotherapy; insomnia comorbid with stable neurological conditions |
| Admit for PSG | If comorbid OSA, PLMD, RBD, or nocturnal seizures suspected and outpatient PSG not feasible; schedule PSG night |
| Admit to floor | Severe sleep deprivation with psychosis or delirium; TBI with severe insomnia and neurobehavioral dysregulation; acute neurological condition (stroke, MS relapse, status epilepticus) with significant sleep disruption requiring inpatient management |
| Transfer to higher level | Not typically applicable for insomnia; consider if severe insomnia-related delirium with agitation requires closer monitoring or if underlying neurological condition warrants ICU care |
| Sleep medicine referral | All patients with insomnia refractory to initial treatment (>=6 weeks CBT-I without improvement); suspected comorbid sleep disorder; need for PSG |
| Neurology referral | Insomnia with new neurological symptoms; suspected neurodegenerative disease; TBI-related insomnia; seizure-related sleep disruption |
| Psychiatry referral | Insomnia with significant comorbid depression, anxiety, PTSD, or substance use; suicidal ideation; medication management complexity |
| Follow-up frequency | Every 2-4 weeks during initial CBT-I or medication titration; every 3 months once stable; annually if in long-term remission |

## NOTES

- Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder, affecting approximately 10-15% of adults with chronic insomnia and 30-35% with acute insomnia symptoms
- CBT-I is recommended as first-line treatment by the ACP, AASM, and European Sleep Research Society; it is effective for insomnia comorbid with neurological conditions including TBI, dementia, Parkinson's disease, MS, and chronic pain
- The "3P model" of insomnia (predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating factors) guides treatment: address perpetuating factors (maladaptive sleep behaviors, conditioned arousal) through CBT-I even when predisposing or precipitating factors are neurological
- Dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs: suvorexant, lemborexant) are emerging as preferred pharmacotherapy, especially in elderly and dementia patients, due to favorable safety profile compared to benzodiazepine receptor agonists
- Sleep restriction therapy should be used with caution in epilepsy patients as acute sleep deprivation can lower seizure threshold; minimum time in bed should be 5-6 hours and titration should be conservative
- Trazodone is the most commonly prescribed medication for insomnia despite limited RCT evidence for this indication; its use is largely based on clinical experience and favorable side effect profile
- Avoid benzodiazepines and "Z-drugs" (zolpidem, zaleplon, eszopiclone) in elderly and neurological patients due to increased risk of falls, cognitive impairment, delirium, complex sleep behaviors, and dependence
- Anticholinergic medications (diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, older antihistamines) are Beers criteria inappropriate in elderly patients; they worsen cognition, cause urinary retention, and increase delirium risk
- Insomnia in Parkinson's disease is multifactorial: dopaminergic medication effects, RBD, nocturia, restless legs, pain, depression, and neurodegeneration of sleep-regulating circuits
- Insomnia in TBI patients is extremely common (30-70%) and often persists long after injury; CBT-I is effective but may need modification for cognitive deficits
- Comorbid insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (COMISA) affects approximately 30-50% of patients with either disorder; treating both conditions simultaneously improves outcomes
- Low melatonin production in elderly and dementia patients provides rationale for exogenous melatonin supplementation; extended-release formulations may better address sleep maintenance
- Always screen for depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and substance use when evaluating insomnia; bidirectional relationships between insomnia and psychiatric conditions are well-established
- In hospitalized neurological patients, optimize the sleep environment: minimize nighttime vitals checks when clinically safe, reduce ambient noise and light, cluster nursing care, maintain day-night lighting cues
