**SYNONYMS:** Hashimoto's encephalopathy, HE, steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis, SREAT, Hashimoto encephalopathy, autoimmune thyroid encephalopathy, anti-TPO encephalopathy, thyroid autoimmune encephalopathy, encephalopathy with thyroid autoantibodies, myxedema madness, nonvasculitic autoimmune inflammatory meningoencephalitis, NAIM, thyroid antibody-associated encephalopathy

**SCOPE:** Diagnostic workup, acute treatment, and long-term management of suspected or confirmed Hashimoto's encephalopathy (SREAT). Covers initial presentation (acute diffuse progressive type and relapsing-remitting vasculitic type), anti-TPO and anti-thyroglobulin antibody evaluation, exclusion of alternative diagnoses, first-line corticosteroid therapy, second-line immunotherapy, seizure management, psychiatric symptom management, ICU considerations for status epilepticus or decreased consciousness, thyroid hormone optimization, and relapse prevention. This is a diagnosis of exclusion requiring elevated anti-thyroid antibodies in the setting of encephalopathy after all other etiologies have been excluded. For antibody-mediated autoimmune encephalitis (anti-NMDAR, LGI1, CASPR2), use "Autoimmune Encephalitis" template. For infectious encephalitis, use "HSV Encephalitis" template. For other metabolic encephalopathies, use appropriate specific template.

### LUMBAR PUNCTURE (CPT 62270)

**Indication:** Essential for diagnosis of Hashimoto's encephalopathy; rules out infectious encephalitis; CSF abnormalities present in ~75-80% of cases (elevated protein is the most common finding); supports exclusion of defined antibody-mediated autoimmune encephalitides

**Timing:** STAT/URGENT -- perform as soon as safely possible after CT head; do NOT delay for MRI

**Volume Required:** 20-30 mL (large volume for comprehensive antibody and infectious testing)

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale | Target Finding |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|----------------|

| AFB culture and smear (CPT 87116) | - | ROUTINE | - | - | TB meningitis if risk factors | Negative |

**Special Handling:** Send minimum 2 mL CSF to each reference lab. CSF anti-TPO can be sent but is not widely validated. Autoimmune encephalitis panel on CSF is MANDATORY to exclude defined antibody-mediated etiologies before diagnosing HE. Store extra CSF (frozen at -20C) for future testing. CSF protein elevation is the most common finding in HE (75-80%).

**Contraindications:** Elevated ICP without imaging (get CT first), coagulopathy (INR >1.5, platelets <50K), skin infection at LP site, posterior fossa mass with risk of herniation

| Ceftriaxone (empiric if bacterial meningitis not excluded) | IV | Pending CSF culture results; empiric bacterial meningitis coverage | 2g :: IV :: q12h :: 2g IV q12h; continue until CSF cultures negative at 48-72h | Cephalosporin allergy; severe penicillin allergy (cross-reactivity) | Cultures; clinical response; CBC; renal function | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Vancomycin (empiric if bacterial meningitis not excluded) | IV | Pending CSF culture results; covers resistant pneumococcus | 15-20 mg/kg :: IV :: q8-12h :: 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h (actual body weight); target trough AUC/MIC 400-600 | Vancomycin allergy; red man syndrome (infuse over >1h) | Vancomycin trough or AUC; renal function daily; ototoxicity | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Dexamethasone (empiric meningitis dose) | IV | Adjunctive with empiric antibiotics for suspected bacterial meningitis | 0.15 mg/kg :: IV :: q6h x 4 days :: 0.15 mg/kg IV q6h x 4 days; give first dose BEFORE or WITH first antibiotic dose | Active fungal infection; known viral meningitis | Glucose; GI bleeding; clinical response | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Lorazepam (acute seizure) | IV | Active seizure | 0.1 mg/kg :: IV :: PRN :: 0.1 mg/kg IV (max 4 mg/dose); repeat x1 in 5 minutes if seizure persists | Respiratory depression; acute narrow-angle glaucoma | Respiratory status; sedation level; airway patency | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Midazolam (if no IV access) | IM | Active seizure without IV access | 10 mg :: IM :: PRN :: 10 mg IM (adults >40 kg) or 0.2 mg/kg intranasal | Respiratory depression | Respiratory status; sedation level; airway patency | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Levothyroxine (if hypothyroid) | IV/PO | Hypothyroidism contributing to encephalopathy | 1.6 mcg/kg :: PO :: daily :: 1.6 mcg/kg/day PO (adjust for age/cardiac status); IV dose is 75% of oral dose if unable to take PO | Untreated adrenal insufficiency (check cortisol first); acute MI (start low) | TSH, free T4 q4-6 weeks; cardiac monitoring in elderly/cardiac patients | URGENT | URGENT | ROUTINE | URGENT |

*Note: Initiate empiric acyclovir and antibiotics IMMEDIATELY when infectious etiology has not been excluded. Do NOT delay antimicrobials for LP results. If clinical suspicion for HE is high based on anti-TPO elevation and exclusion workup is underway, corticosteroids can be started concurrently -- a dramatic response to steroids is both therapeutic and diagnostically supportive.*

### 3B. First-Line Immunotherapy (Corticosteroids)

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Methylprednisolone IV (CPT 96365) | IV | First-line treatment; dramatic steroid response is hallmark of HE | 1000 mg :: IV :: daily :: 1000 mg IV daily x 3-5 days; infuse over 1-2 hours; most patients show improvement within 24-72 hours | Active untreated infection; uncontrolled diabetes; psychosis from steroids | Glucose q6h (target <180); BP; mood/sleep; I/O; GI prophylaxis | URGENT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Omeprazole (GI prophylaxis during steroids) | PO/IV | GI protection during high-dose steroid therapy | 40 mg :: IV :: daily :: 40 mg IV/PO daily during steroid course and taper | PPI allergy | None routine | URGENT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Insulin sliding scale | SC | Steroid-induced hyperglycemia | Per protocol :: SC :: PRN :: Per protocol if glucose >180 mg/dL | Hypoglycemia risk | Glucose q6h; adjust per response | URGENT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Oral prednisone taper (following IV methylprednisolone) | PO | Maintenance after IV pulse; prevent relapse | 1 mg/kg :: PO :: daily :: 1 mg/kg/day (max 60-80 mg) x 2-4 weeks; taper by 10 mg every 1-2 weeks to 20 mg; then taper by 5 mg every 1-2 weeks; total taper over 3-6 months; SLOW taper critical (relapse rate 40-50% with rapid taper) | Active infection; uncontrolled diabetes; avascular necrosis | Glucose; BP; bone density if prolonged; mood; weight; adrenal insufficiency on taper; relapse monitoring | - | STAT | ROUTINE | - |

*Note: Corticosteroids are the HALLMARK treatment of Hashimoto's encephalopathy. A dramatic response to IV methylprednisolone (often within 24-72 hours) is both therapeutically and diagnostically critical -- lack of steroid response prompts reconsideration of the diagnosis. Relapse rates are 40-50%, most commonly associated with rapid steroid taper. Prolonged slow taper (3-6 months minimum) significantly reduces relapse risk. Some patients require indefinite low-dose steroids or steroid-sparing agents.*

### 3C. Second-Line Immunotherapy (Steroid-Sparing / Refractory)

*Note: Seizures occur in approximately 60-70% of Hashimoto's encephalopathy patients and present as focal, generalized, or status epilepticus. Immunotherapy (corticosteroids) is the definitive seizure treatment -- ASMs control acute seizures but do not resolve the underlying autoimmune process. Many patients can be tapered off ASMs once immunotherapy achieves remission. Levetiracetam is preferred first-line given favorable drug interaction profile with immunotherapy. Status epilepticus occurs in ~10-15% and requires aggressive management.*

### 3E. Psychiatric Symptom Management

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |

*Note: Psychiatric symptoms (psychosis, depression, hallucinations, personality change, agitation) occur in approximately 35-45% of Hashimoto's encephalopathy. These symptoms are driven by the autoimmune process -- immunotherapy is the definitive treatment. Antipsychotics and other psychiatric medications provide symptomatic relief and are used at lowest effective doses, then tapered as immunotherapy takes effect. Standard NMS precautions apply with antipsychotic use.*

### 3F. ICU-Specific Treatments

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Intubation and mechanical ventilation | - | Status epilepticus requiring anesthetic infusions; severe decreased consciousness (GCS <8); inability to protect airway | RSI per protocol :: - :: - :: Avoid succinylcholine if hyperkalemia risk; maintain normocapnia; daily spontaneous breathing trials when appropriate | As per standard airway management | Ventilator parameters; ABG; daily SBT assessment | - | - | - | STAT |

| Famotidine (stress ulcer prophylaxis) | IV | ICU admission with steroid use | 20 mg :: IV :: q12h :: 20 mg IV q12h | GFR <50 (reduce dose) | GI bleeding signs | - | - | - | STAT |

*Note: ICU admission is required for status epilepticus (~10-15% of HE), severe decreased consciousness, or myxedema coma overlap. Unlike anti-NMDAR encephalitis, prolonged autonomic instability is uncommon in HE. ICU course is typically shorter if corticosteroids are initiated promptly. Continue aggressive immunotherapy during ICU stay.*

### 3G. Long-Term Maintenance & Relapse Prevention

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Oral prednisone (low-dose maintenance) | PO | Relapse prevention; some patients require long-term low-dose steroids | 5-10 mg :: PO :: daily :: 5-10 mg PO daily; aim to taper off if on steroid-sparing agent; some patients require indefinite low-dose | Poorly controlled diabetes; active infection; avascular necrosis | Glucose; BP; bone density (DEXA if >3 months); weight; mood; cataracts; adrenal assessment on taper | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Azathioprine (maintenance) | PO | Steroid-sparing maintenance; relapse prevention | 2-3 mg/kg :: PO :: daily :: 2-3 mg/kg/day (target established during initial titration) | TPMT deficiency; pregnancy | CBC monthly; LFTs q3 months; infection surveillance | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

| Levothyroxine (thyroid optimization) | PO | Maintain euthyroid state; hypothyroidism present in 25-30% | 1.6 mcg/kg :: PO :: daily :: 1.6 mcg/kg/day PO; adjust to keep TSH 0.5-2.5 mIU/L | Adrenal insufficiency (correct first); acute cardiac disease | TSH, free T4 q4-6 weeks until stable, then q3-6 months | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Calcium + Vitamin D (bone protection with steroids) | PO | All patients on steroids >3 months | 1000-1200 mg/day :: PO :: daily :: Calcium 1000-1200 mg/day + Vitamin D 1000-2000 IU/day | Hypercalcemia; kidney stones | 25-OH Vitamin D level; calcium; DEXA baseline if anticipated steroid use >3 months | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| IVIG (maintenance) | IV | Multiply-relapsing HE; steroid-dependent | 0.4 g/kg :: IV :: monthly :: 0.4 g/kg IV every 4 weeks (adjust per response) | IgA deficiency; thromboembolic history | Renal function; headache; IgG trough levels; infusion reactions | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

*Note: Relapse rate in Hashimoto's encephalopathy is approximately 40-50%, making long-term management critical. Most relapses occur during steroid taper, particularly if tapered too rapidly. Steroid-sparing agents (azathioprine, mycophenolate) are indicated for patients requiring prolonged steroids or experiencing relapses. Thyroid hormone optimization is important but does NOT treat the encephalopathy itself -- immunotherapy is required regardless of thyroid status. Duration of maintenance therapy is individualized; some patients achieve lasting remission after 1-2 years while others require indefinite treatment.*

### 4C. Hashimoto's Encephalopathy Subtypes & Clinical Patterns

| Subtype | Clinical Features | EEG Pattern | MRI Pattern | Prognosis |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Diffuse progressive (Type 1) | Acute/subacute cognitive decline; dementia-like presentation; confusion; somnolence progressing to coma | Diffuse slowing (theta-delta); FIRDA; triphasic waves | Often normal; diffuse white matter changes possible | Generally good with steroids; more cognitive sequelae possible |
| Relapsing-remitting (Type 2) | Episodic stroke-like events; focal deficits; seizures; fluctuating course; mimics TIA/stroke | Focal slowing; epileptiform discharges; lateralized abnormalities | Focal T2/FLAIR signal changes; stroke-like lesions possible | Good with steroids but higher relapse rate; requires longer maintenance |
| Seizure-predominant | Status epilepticus or recurrent seizures as primary presentation; minimal other symptoms possible | Epileptiform discharges; electrographic seizures; FIRDA possible | Normal or periictal changes | Excellent if seizures controlled with steroids + ASMs |
| Psychiatric-predominant | Psychosis, depression, personality change, hallucinations as primary features; frequently misdiagnosed as primary psychiatric | Diffuse slowing; usually non-epileptiform | Often normal | Good with steroids; psychiatric symptoms resolve as immunotherapy takes effect |

*Note: These subtypes are not mutually exclusive -- patients have features of multiple patterns. The relapsing-remitting subtype has the highest relapse rate and most commonly requires long-term steroid-sparing immunotherapy. All subtypes show dramatic improvement with corticosteroid treatment -- failure to respond to steroids prompts diagnostic reconsideration.*

## CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT NOTES

### Diagnostic Criteria for Hashimoto's Encephalopathy (Consensus)

All of the following must be met:
- [ ] Encephalopathy (acute or subacute onset of cognitive decline, altered consciousness, seizures, or psychiatric symptoms)
- [ ] Elevated anti-TPO antibodies (>200 IU/mL strongly suggestive; any elevation in context) and/or anti-thyroglobulin antibodies
- [ ] Reasonable exclusion of ALL other causes including: infectious encephalitis, defined antibody-mediated autoimmune encephalitis (NMDAR, LGI1, CASPR2, etc.), metabolic encephalopathy, toxic exposure, CNS vasculitis, prion disease, malignancy, psychiatric disorder
- [ ] Dramatic response to corticosteroid therapy (supports diagnosis; lack of response prompts reconsideration)
- [ ] CSF excludes infection and does not suggest alternative diagnosis

### Red Flags for Hashimoto's Encephalopathy

- [ ] Subacute encephalopathy + markedly elevated anti-TPO (>200 IU/mL) + euthyroid or mildly hypothyroid
- [ ] Fluctuating encephalopathy with EEG showing diffuse slowing or FIRDA/triphasic waves
- [ ] Stroke-like episodes in a patient with elevated thyroid antibodies (relapsing-remitting type)
- [ ] Seizures or status epilepticus in a patient with known Hashimoto thyroiditis
- [ ] Rapidly progressive cognitive decline with elevated anti-TPO and all other workup negative
- [ ] Encephalopathy that dramatically improves with IV steroids (diagnostic and therapeutic)
- [ ] Psychiatric presentation (psychosis, personality change) with elevated thyroid antibodies and abnormal EEG
- [ ] Recurrent encephalopathy episodes correlating with steroid taper
- [ ] Encephalopathy in a female patient aged 40-60 with history of autoimmune thyroid disease
- [ ] "Treatment-resistant psychiatric illness" with elevated anti-TPO -- reassess as HE

### Key Diagnostic Pitfalls

1. **Do NOT diagnose HE based on anti-TPO alone** -- anti-TPO is present in 10-13% of the general population; elevated titers are necessary but not sufficient
2. **MUST exclude defined autoimmune encephalitides** -- anti-NMDAR, LGI1, CASPR2, GABA-B antibody testing is mandatory before attributing encephalopathy to anti-TPO
3. **Thyroid status does NOT determine diagnosis** -- patients are euthyroid (most common), hypothyroid, or hyperthyroid
4. **Anti-TPO titers do NOT correlate with severity** -- do not use titer levels to guide treatment escalation or tapering decisions
5. **Steroid response is diagnostically critical** -- failure to improve with adequate steroid trial (5 days of IV pulse + oral taper) prompts diagnostic re-evaluation
6. **Differentiate from myxedema coma** -- myxedema responds to thyroid hormone; HE responds to steroids (not thyroid hormone alone)

## APPENDIX A: Hashimoto's Encephalopathy vs Myxedema Coma

| Feature | Hashimoto's Encephalopathy (SREAT) | Myxedema Coma |
|---------|-------------------------------------|---------------|
| Thyroid status | Euthyroid (most common), mildly hypothyroid, or rarely hyperthyroid | Severely hypothyroid (very low T4, very high TSH) |
| Anti-TPO antibodies | Elevated (required for diagnosis) | May or may not be elevated |
| Key treatment | High-dose IV corticosteroids | IV levothyroxine + IV hydrocortisone |
| Response to thyroid hormone alone | Does NOT treat encephalopathy | Primary treatment |
| Response to steroids | Dramatic improvement within days | Steroids given empirically (adrenal insufficiency concern) but not primary treatment |
| Temperature | Usually normal | Hypothermia characteristic |
| Heart rate | Usually normal | Bradycardia characteristic |
| Reflexes | Variable | Delayed relaxation phase (hung-up reflexes) |
| CSF protein | Elevated in 75-80% | May be mildly elevated |
| EEG | Diffuse slowing, FIRDA, triphasic waves, epileptiform | Diffuse slowing; low voltage |
| Prognosis | Excellent with steroids; relapse common | High mortality (30-60%) even with treatment |

---

## APPENDIX B: EEG Patterns in Hashimoto's Encephalopathy

| EEG Pattern | Frequency in HE | Clinical Significance |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Generalized slowing (theta-delta) | ~90% | Most common finding; nonspecific but consistent with encephalopathy |
| Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) | ~20-30% | Suggests diffuse cortical dysfunction; seen in metabolic encephalopathies |
| Triphasic waves | ~10-15% | Classically associated with metabolic encephalopathy; reported in HE; differentiate from hepatic/uremic causes |
| Epileptiform discharges (focal or generalized) | ~20-30% | Indicates seizure risk; correlates with seizure-predominant subtype |
| Focal slowing | ~15-25% | Seen in relapsing-remitting (type 2) subtype; correlates with focal MRI lesions |
| Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs/LPDs) | ~5% | Rare; exclude HSV encephalitis, stroke, or other structural cause |
| Normal EEG | ~10% | Does not exclude HE; clinical presentation and anti-TPO levels guide diagnosis |

---

## APPENDIX C: Anti-TPO Titer Interpretation

| Anti-TPO Level | Interpretation | Action |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Negative (<35 IU/mL) | HE very unlikely (excludes >95% of cases) | Strongly pursue alternative diagnoses |
| Mildly elevated (35-100 IU/mL) | Present in ~5-10% of general population; low specificity for HE | HE possible but diagnosis requires strong clinical evidence and exclusion of all alternatives |
| Moderately elevated (100-200 IU/mL) | Increased specificity for autoimmune thyroid disease | Supportive of HE diagnosis in appropriate clinical context after thorough exclusion workup |
| Markedly elevated (>200 IU/mL) | Strongly supportive in clinical context | High suspicion for HE if clinical features present and alternatives excluded; initiate steroid trial |
| Very high (>1000 IU/mL) | Highly suggestive in appropriate clinical context | Very supportive but still requires exclusion workup; titers do NOT correlate with severity |

*Note: No anti-TPO cutoff value is diagnostic of HE. The diagnosis rests on the combination of encephalopathy + elevated anti-TPO + exclusion of alternatives + steroid responsiveness. Anti-TPO titers are NOT used to guide treatment escalation or tapering.*
