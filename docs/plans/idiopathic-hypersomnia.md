# Idiopathic Hypersomnia

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** February 7, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Idiopathic Hypersomnia

**ICD-10:** G47.11 (Idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time), G47.12 (Idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time)

**CPT CODES:** 95810 (Polysomnography (PSG)), 95805 (Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT)), 95803 (Actigraphy (2 weeks)), 85025 (CBC), 80053 (CMP), 84443 (TSH), 82607 (Vitamin B12), 82728 (Serum ferritin), 80307 (Urine drug screen), 70553 (MRI brain with and without contrast), 81383 (HLA-DQB1*06:02 typing)

**SYNONYMS:** Idiopathic hypersomnia, IH, primary hypersomnia, idiopathic hypersomnolence, excessive daytime sleepiness NOS, central disorder of hypersomnolence, non-narcoleptic hypersomnia, long sleeper syndrome

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis and management of idiopathic hypersomnia in adults. Covers the diagnostic workup distinguishing IH from narcolepsy type 2, insufficient sleep syndrome, and other causes of excessive daytime sleepiness. Includes PSG/MSLT interpretation, pharmacologic treatment of EDS and sleep inertia/sleep drunkenness, and long-term management. Excludes narcolepsy (separate plan), hypersomnia due to medical conditions, Kleine-Levin syndrome, and medication-induced hypersomnia.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Idiopathic Hypersomnia (IH):** Central disorder of hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and/or prolonged total sleep time (≥11 hours/24 hours) without cataplexy and without ≥2 SOREMPs on MSLT; etiology unknown
- **Sleep Drunkenness (Severe Sleep Inertia):** Profound difficulty awakening from sleep with prolonged confusion, disorientation, automatic behavior, and impaired cognitive function lasting 30 minutes to several hours after awakening; hallmark feature of IH
- **Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS):** Inability to maintain sustained wakefulness during the day despite adequate or prolonged nocturnal sleep; distinguishable from fatigue by the irrepressible need to sleep
- **Sleep-Onset REM Period (SOREMP):** REM sleep occurring within 15 minutes of sleep onset on PSG or MSLT; fewer than 2 SOREMPs on MSLT is required for IH diagnosis (≥2 SOREMPs suggests narcolepsy)
- **Long Sleep Time Phenotype:** Total 24-hour sleep time ≥660 minutes (11 hours) documented by PSG or actigraphy; present in a subset of IH patients
- **Mean Sleep Latency:** Average time to fall asleep across nap opportunities on MSLT; ≤8 minutes indicates pathological sleepiness

---

**DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (ICSD-3-TR):**

**Idiopathic Hypersomnia — All of the following:**

1. Daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep for ≥3 months
2. Cataplexy is absent
3. MSLT shows fewer than 2 SOREMPs (or MSLT is not performed)
4. At least one of the following:
    - MSLT mean sleep latency ≤8 minutes, OR
    - Total 24-hour sleep time ≥660 minutes (11 hours) on 24-hour PSG or wrist actigraphy (averaged over ≥7 days, adjusted for age)
5. Insufficient sleep syndrome is ruled out (actigraphy or sleep diary for ≥2 weeks demonstrating habitual sleep duration ≥7 hours/night)
6. Not better explained by another sleep disorder, medical condition, psychiatric disorder, medication, or substance use

**Key Clinical Features:**

1. Excessive daytime sleepiness (100% of patients; present despite adequate or prolonged nocturnal sleep)
2. Sleep drunkenness / severe sleep inertia (~50-80%; hallmark feature distinguishing IH from narcolepsy)
3. Prolonged, unrefreshing naps (naps in IH are long and non-restorative, unlike the short refreshing naps in narcolepsy)
4. Difficulty awakening from sleep despite alarms (often requiring assistance from others)
5. Cognitive fog / "brain fog" during the day (impaired concentration, attention, and memory)
6. Prolonged nocturnal sleep (≥11 hours in the long sleep time phenotype)

**Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Severity:**
- Normal: 0-10
- Mild sleepiness: 11-14
- Moderate sleepiness: 15-17
- Severe sleepiness: 18-24

## 4. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS

### 4A. Referrals & Consults

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Sleep medicine specialist for PSG/MSLT scheduling, diagnosis confirmation, treatment initiation and optimization (IH requires specialist-level interpretation of MSLT results) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Neuropsychology if cognitive complaints are prominent (IH-related cognitive fog requires formal testing to document deficits and guide accommodations) | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Occupational medicine for fitness-for-duty evaluation, driving safety assessment, and workplace accommodation (IH poses significant occupational safety risk particularly due to sleep inertia) | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Psychiatry if comorbid depression or anxiety requiring treatment (common comorbidities in IH; must distinguish depression-related hypersomnia from IH) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Social work for disability evaluation and community resource coordination (IH causes significant functional impairment; many patients qualify for workplace accommodations under ADA) | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

### 4B. Patient/Family Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Idiopathic hypersomnia is a chronic neurological condition of the brain's sleep-wake regulation system; it is not laziness, depression, or a behavioral choice | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Do not drive until excessive daytime sleepiness is adequately controlled with treatment (risk of drowsy driving is highest in the morning due to sleep inertia) | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Use multiple alarm systems with escalating intensity to overcome sleep drunkenness; place alarms away from bed; consider recruiting a household member as backup for important mornings | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Naps in IH are typically long and unrefreshing (unlike narcolepsy where short naps are restorative); limit nap duration to 30-60 minutes to avoid worsening sleep inertia from deep nap sleep | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Notify all providers about IH diagnosis before any sedation or anesthesia (patients with IH may have prolonged recovery from sedation due to baseline hypersomnolence) | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid alcohol and sedating medications (antihistamines, benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants) which worsen excessive sleepiness and sleep drunkenness | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| If prescribed Xywav (low-sodium oxybate): REMS enrollment required; prepare both doses before bedtime; do not take within 2 hours of food; no alcohol; store securely | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Hypersomnia Foundation (hypersomniafoundation.org) for patient resources, support groups, and research updates specific to IH | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Maintain consistent sleep-wake schedule with a strict fixed wake time every day (including weekends) to consolidate the circadian wake signal | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Morning light exposure (30 minutes of bright light or outdoor light immediately upon awakening) to counteract sleep inertia and reinforce the circadian wake signal | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Regular moderate exercise (30 minutes daily, morning preferred) to improve daytime alertness; avoid vigorous exercise close to bedtime which may fragment sleep | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid heavy meals during the day as postprandial sleepiness compounds existing EDS in IH patients | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Strategic napping: unlike narcolepsy, naps in IH are generally unrefreshing; if naps are used, limit to 20-30 minutes and set multiple alarms (longer naps worsen sleep inertia) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Inform employer about IH diagnosis for reasonable workplace accommodations under ADA (flexible start time to accommodate sleep inertia, scheduled break periods, avoidance of monotonous or safety-critical tasks during low-alertness periods) | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid alcohol and sedatives which exacerbate EDS; limit caffeine to morning hours to avoid disrupting nocturnal sleep quality | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Narcolepsy type 2 | MSLT shows ≥2 SOREMPs; naps are short and refreshing; less prominent sleep inertia; cataplexy absent (same as IH); MSLT is the primary differentiator | MSLT: ≥2 SOREMPs (NT2) vs. <2 SOREMPs (IH) |
| Insufficient sleep syndrome | Most common mimic; chronic volitional sleep restriction; resolves with sleep extension to ≥7-8 hours/night; normal MSLT after adequate sleep | Actigraphy ≥2 weeks showing habitual sleep <7 hours; resolution of EDS with sleep extension trial |
| Long sleeper (normal variant) | Constitutionally long sleep need (≥10 hours) but feel refreshed upon awakening; no EDS when sleep need is met; no sleep drunkenness | Sleep extension trial: EDS resolves when full sleep need met; ESS normal when well-rested |
| Medication-induced hypersomnia | Temporal relationship to medication initiation (sedating antidepressants, antipsychotics, antihistamines, anticonvulsants, opioids); resolves with dose reduction or discontinuation | Medication review; temporal correlation; MSLT normalizes after medication discontinuation |
| Depression-related hypersomnia | Depressed mood, anhedonia, psychomotor retardation; fatigue more than true sleepiness; may have increased time in bed but MSLT usually normal; sleep often fragmented | Psychiatric evaluation; PHQ-9 ≥10; MSLT typically mean latency >8 min and <2 SOREMPs |
| Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) | Snoring, witnessed apneas, obesity; EDS improves with CPAP; no sleep drunkenness; fragmented sleep on PSG | PSG with respiratory scoring; AHI >5 events/hour; EDS resolves with CPAP treatment |
| Hypothyroidism | Fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, dry skin; generalized slowing; no SOREMPs | TSH elevated; free T4 low; EDS resolves with thyroid replacement |
| Kleine-Levin syndrome | Recurrent episodes of profound hypersomnia lasting days-weeks with cognitive and behavioral disturbances (hyperphagia, hypersexuality, derealization); completely asymptomatic between episodes | Episodic pattern (recurrence-remission); normal inter-episode PSG/MSLT; onset typically in adolescence |
| Post-traumatic hypersomnia | EDS developing after TBI; temporal relationship to head injury; may have prolonged sleep time similar to IH; may or may not resolve over time | History of TBI preceding hypersomnia; neuroimaging may show injury; onset within 6-12 months of TBI |
| Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder | Misalignment of endogenous circadian rhythm (delayed sleep-wake phase disorder most common); sleepiness is time-of-day dependent | Actigraphy showing delayed sleep-wake phase; sleep log; DLMO (dim light melatonin onset) |

## NOTES

- Idiopathic hypersomnia is a central disorder of hypersomnolence with unknown etiology; the "idiopathic" designation means no identifiable cause despite thorough evaluation
- Sleep drunkenness (severe sleep inertia) is the most characteristic feature of IH and a major source of functional impairment; patients may exhibit confusion, automatic behavior, and even aggression upon forced awakening
- Unlike narcolepsy, naps in IH are typically prolonged (30-60+ minutes) and non-refreshing; this is a key clinical distinction during history taking
- The ICSD-3-TR eliminated the prior division into IH with and without long sleep time as separate diagnoses; both are now classified under a single IH diagnosis with total sleep time ≥660 minutes as one of two objective criteria (the other being MSLT mean latency ≤8 minutes)
- MSLT has test-retest variability (~20% of patients may shift between IH and NT2 on repeat testing); clinical context is essential for diagnosis
- Insufficient sleep syndrome is the most common mimic and must be rigorously excluded with ≥2 weeks of actigraphy or sleep diary showing adequate habitual sleep before MSLT is performed
- Low-sodium oxybate (Xywav) is currently the only FDA-approved medication specifically for IH; it is the only treatment shown to reduce both EDS and total sleep time
- The GABA-A receptor potentiation hypothesis proposes that a substance in IH patients' CSF enhances GABA-A receptor function, producing a state similar to chronic low-grade sedation; this is the rationale for flumazenil and clarithromycin as investigational treatments
- Modafinil, armodafinil, stimulants, pitolisant, and solriamfetol are used off-label for IH based on extrapolation from narcolepsy trials and clinical experience
- Comorbid depression is common in IH (30-50%); it may be a consequence of chronic hypersomnia rather than a cause, and requires concurrent treatment
- IH onset is typically in late adolescence or young adulthood; diagnosis is often delayed years due to overlap with depression, insufficient sleep, and low disease awareness
- Pregnancy management: discontinue Xywav and stimulants; non-pharmacologic measures (alarms, light therapy, scheduled rest) become primary treatment; modafinil is pregnancy category C with limited data
- Spontaneous remission occurs in a minority of patients (~14-25%); periodic reassessment of ongoing need for treatment is warranted

## CHANGE LOG

**v1.0 (February 7, 2026)**
- Initial template creation
- ICSD-3-TR diagnostic criteria for idiopathic hypersomnia
- Comprehensive pharmacologic treatment: wake-promoting agents (modafinil, armodafinil, low-sodium oxybate), second-line agents (solriamfetol, methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, pitolisant), sleep inertia management (caffeine, flumazenil), adjunctive agents (melatonin, clarithromycin)
- Non-pharmacologic interventions including strategic alarm systems, light therapy, and safety counseling
- Structured dosing format with :: delimiters for all medications
- 10-column treatment tables throughout
- PubMed citations for all major evidence sources
- Differential diagnosis distinguishing IH from narcolepsy type 2, insufficient sleep syndrome, long sleeper, and other hypersomnias

## APPENDIX A: MSLT Preparation Protocol for IH Diagnosis

**Prerequisites for Valid MSLT (Same as Narcolepsy MSLT Protocol):**

1. **Sleep diary or actigraphy** for ≥2 weeks documenting adequate habitual sleep (≥7 hours/night) — this is critical to exclude insufficient sleep syndrome
2. **Discontinue REM-suppressant medications** ≥2 weeks prior (≥5 weeks for fluoxetine due to long half-life):
    - SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, escitalopram, citalopram)
    - SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine, desvenlafaxine)
    - TCAs (clomipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline)
    - Tramadol
    - MAOIs
3. **Discontinue stimulants** ≥2 weeks prior (modafinil, methylphenidate, amphetamines)
4. **Urine drug screen** on day of study to confirm medication discontinuation and absence of recreational drugs
5. **Preceding nocturnal PSG** must show:
    - ≥6 hours total sleep time
    - No untreated severe OSA (AHI >30) that could confound results
6. **MSLT protocol:**
    - 5 nap opportunities at 2-hour intervals starting 1.5-3 hours after morning awakening
    - Each nap opportunity lasts 20 minutes; extended to 35 minutes if sleep onset occurs (to evaluate for SOREMP)
    - Record sleep latency and presence of REM sleep for each nap
7. **IH-diagnostic result:** Mean sleep latency ≤8 minutes with **fewer than 2 SOREMPs** (0 or 1)
    - If ≥2 SOREMPs: reclassify as narcolepsy type 2
    - If mean latency >8 min with <2 SOREMPs: does not meet MSLT criteria for IH (consider 24-hr PSG for total sleep time criterion)

## APPENDIX B: Low-Sodium Oxybate (Xywav) Prescribing Guide for IH

**REMS Program Requirements (Same as Narcolepsy Indication):**
- Prescriber, pharmacy, and patient must all be enrolled in the Xywav REMS program
- Distributed only through central pharmacy (Jazz Pharmaceuticals)
- Patient must sign acknowledgment of risks

**Dosing Protocol for IH:**
1. **Starting dose:** 4.5 g/night divided into 2 equal doses
2. **First dose:** 2.25 g at bedtime (in bed, ready for sleep)
3. **Second dose:** 2.25 g taken 2.5-4 hours later (set alarm)
4. **Titrate:** Increase by 1.5 g/night (0.75 g per dose) every 1-2 weeks
5. **Effective range:** 6-9 g/night
6. **Maximum dose:** 9 g/night

**Critical Safety Instructions:**
- Prepare both doses before bedtime; place second dose at bedside
- Do not take within 2 hours of eating (food delays absorption)
- Do not take with alcohol or other CNS depressants
- Allow ≥6 hours between second dose and any activity requiring alertness
- Store in secure location out of reach of others (abuse potential)
- Monitor for sleepwalking, confusion, respiratory depression
- Lower sodium content (92% less than Xyrem); preferred formulation for IH

**IH-Specific Considerations:**
- Xywav is the only FDA-approved medication for IH (approved July 2021)
- In IH, Xywav uniquely reduces total sleep time and improves sleep inertia in addition to reducing EDS
- Patients with severe sleep inertia may benefit most from Xywav (addresses the most functionally impairing aspect of IH)
- Monitor for adequate second-dose awakening — severe sleep drunkenness may impair ability to wake for the second dose; consider assistance from household member
