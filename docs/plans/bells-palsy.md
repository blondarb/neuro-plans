# Bell's Palsy

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 29, 2026
**REVISED:** January 29, 2026
**STATUS:** Complete

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Bell's Palsy / Idiopathic Facial Paralysis

**ICD-10:** G51.0 (Bell's palsy), G51.8 (Other disorders of facial nerve), G51.9 (Disorder of facial nerve, unspecified), B02.21 (Postherpetic geniculate ganglionitis - Ramsay Hunt)

**SYNONYMS:** Bell's palsy, Bell palsy, idiopathic facial paralysis, facial palsy, facial nerve palsy, acute peripheral facial palsy, seventh nerve palsy, CN VII palsy, facial weakness

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis and management of Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial nerve palsy) in adults. Covers workup to exclude secondary causes, medical treatment, and eye protection. Includes Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus) which requires different treatment. Excludes central facial palsy (stroke), facial nerve tumors, traumatic facial nerve injury, and bilateral facial palsy workup.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Bell's Palsy:** Acute idiopathic unilateral peripheral facial nerve (CN VII) weakness
- **Peripheral Facial Palsy:** Weakness affecting upper AND lower face (forehead involvement)
- **Central Facial Palsy:** Weakness affecting lower face only with forehead sparing (upper motor neuron lesion)
- **House-Brackmann Scale:** Grading system for facial nerve function (I-VI)
- **Ramsay Hunt Syndrome:** Facial palsy with herpes zoster oticus (vesicles in ear canal/pinna)

---

**HOUSE-BRACKMANN GRADING SCALE:**

| Grade | Description | Characteristics |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| I | Normal | Normal facial function |
| II | Mild dysfunction | Slight weakness on close inspection; complete eye closure with effort |
| III | Moderate dysfunction | Obvious but not disfiguring weakness; may not completely close eye; forehead movement present |
| IV | Moderately severe | Obvious weakness and disfiguring asymmetry; cannot completely close eye; no forehead movement |
| V | Severe dysfunction | Barely perceptible motion; incomplete eye closure; slight movement at corner of mouth |
| VI | Total paralysis | No movement; loss of tone |

## NOTES

- Bell's palsy is a diagnosis of EXCLUSION - always evaluate for secondary causes
- Forehead involvement (peripheral pattern) distinguishes from stroke (forehead spared = central pattern)
- **TIME-SENSITIVE:** Steroids most effective if started within 72 hours of symptom onset
- Eye protection is critical and often under-emphasized - corneal ulceration is preventable
- Always examine the ear for vesicles (Ramsay Hunt syndrome requires antivirals)
- Prognosis: 70-80% full recovery; 15-20% have residual weakness; 5% have severe sequelae
- Poor prognostic factors: Complete paralysis (HB VI), no recovery by 3 weeks, age >60, diabetes, Ramsay Hunt syndrome
- Synkinesis (aberrant regeneration) can develop during recovery - PT helps prevent/manage
- Recurrent Bell's palsy is uncommon (~7%); warrants additional workup
- Bilateral facial palsy is NOT Bell's palsy - requires workup for Lyme, GBS, sarcoidosis, etc.
