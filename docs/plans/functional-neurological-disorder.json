  "scope": "** Diagnosis (positive clinical signs), acute management, and long-term multidisciplinary treatment of FND. Covers functional motor symptoms (weakness, tremor, dystonia, gait disorder, myoclonus, parkinsonism), functional seizures (PNES/dissociative seizures), functional sensory symptoms, and functional cognitive symptoms. Emphasizes POSITIVE diagnosis based on clinical signs (not diagnosis of exclusion). Includes communication strategies, physical rehabilitation, psychological treatment, and pharmacologic management of comorbidities. For epilepsy, see \"New Onset Seizure\" and \"Status Epilepticus\" templates. For organic movement disorders, see specific disorder templates.",
