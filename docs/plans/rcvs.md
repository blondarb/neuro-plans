# Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS)

**DIAGNOSIS:** Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS)

**ICD-10:** I67.841 (Reversible cerebrovascular vasoconstriction syndrome), I67.848 (Other cerebrovascular vasospasm and vasoconstriction)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC with differential), 80053 (CMP (BMP + LFTs)), 85652 (ESR), 86140 (CRP), 84703 (Pregnancy test (beta-hCG)), 80307 (Urine drug screen), 84443 (TSH), 83735 (Magnesium), 84484 (Troponin), 86235 (ANA), 86592 (Syphilis screen (RPR/VDRL)), 87389 (HIV screen), 84260 (Serum serotonin), 82164 (ACE level), 70450 (CT head without contrast), 70496 (CT angiography head (CTA)), 70551 (MRI brain without contrast), 70544 (MRA head), 93000 (ECG (12-lead)), 70553 (MRI brain with and without contrast), 36224 (Conventional cerebral angiography (DSA)), 93886 (Transcranial Doppler (TCD)), 93306 (Echocardiogram (TTE)), 62270 (LUMBAR PUNCTURE), 89051 (Cell count (tubes 1 and 4)), 84157 (Protein), 82945 (Glucose with serum glucose), 88108 (Cytology)

**SYNONYMS:** Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, RCVS, Call-Fleming syndrome, thunderclap headache syndrome, benign angiopathy of the CNS, postpartum angiopathy, migrainous vasospasm, drug-induced cerebral vasospasm, reversible cerebral segmental vasoconstriction, bath-related thunderclap headache, sexual headache with vasoconstriction, cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis, acute management, and follow-up of RCVS in adults. Covers thunderclap headache evaluation, vasoconstrictor identification and withdrawal, calcium channel blocker therapy, blood pressure management, monitoring for complications (convexity SAH, ischemic stroke, PRES overlap), and serial imaging to document resolution. Excludes primary CNS vasculitis (PACNS — separate evaluation), aneurysmal SAH, and isolated thunderclap headache without vasoconstriction.

**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **RCVS:** Syndrome characterized by severe thunderclap headaches with segmental vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries that resolves within 12 weeks
- **Thunderclap Headache:** Severe headache reaching maximum intensity within 60 seconds, often described as "worst headache of life"
- **"String of Beads" Pattern:** Alternating areas of segmental narrowing and dilation of cerebral arteries on angiography — hallmark of RCVS
- **RCVS Complications:** Convexity SAH (most common, ~30%), ischemic stroke (~10-40%), PRES overlap (~10-40%), intracerebral hemorrhage (~5-10%)

### LUMBAR PUNCTURE (CPT 62270)

**Indication:** Thunderclap headache workup to exclude SAH (if CT negative), meningitis/encephalitis, and to differentiate RCVS from PACNS. CSF is typically NORMAL or near-normal in RCVS; CSF abnormalities (pleocytosis >10 WBC, elevated protein >60) strongly favor PACNS or infection.

**Timing:** URGENT after CT excludes mass effect; ideally within 24 hours of presentation.

**Volume Required:** 10-15 mL (standard diagnostic)

| Study | Rationale | Target Finding | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-------|-----------|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Opening pressure | Elevated in SAH, IIH; typically normal in RCVS | 10-20 cm H2O (normal in RCVS) | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | URGENT |
| Cell count (tubes 1 and 4) (CPT 89051) | SAH (RBC non-clearing); meningitis (WBC); RCVS typically <10 WBC. WBC >10 strongly suggests PACNS or infection | WBC <5; RBC 0 or clearing (RCVS: normal or minimal pleocytosis <10 WBC) | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | URGENT |
| Protein (CPT 84157) | Elevated in vasculitis, infection; RCVS typically normal or mildly elevated (<60 mg/dL). Protein >60 suggests PACNS | 15-45 mg/dL (RCVS: normal or mildly elevated) | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | URGENT |
| Glucose with serum glucose (CPT 82945) | Low CSF glucose suggests infection; normal in RCVS and PACNS | >60% of serum glucose (normal) | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | URGENT |
| Xanthochromia | Rule out SAH if CT negative; present if prior subarachnoid bleeding | Negative (unless convexity SAH present) | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | URGENT |
| Gram stain and culture (CPT 87205, 87070) | Exclude bacterial meningitis (meningismus overlap with thunderclap headache) | No organisms | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | URGENT |
| Cytology (CPT 88108) | Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis causing vessel encasement and secondary vasoconstriction | Negative | - | ROUTINE | - | - |
| Fungal culture | Fungal meningitis with secondary vasculopathy (immunocompromised) | No growth | - | ROUTINE | - | - |

**Special Handling:** Xanthochromia sample must be protected from light; centrifuge immediately.

**Contraindications:** Mass lesion on CT with midline shift; coagulopathy (INR >1.5, platelets <50,000); local skin infection at puncture site.

**Key Interpretation:** In RCVS, CSF is typically normal or shows only mild abnormalities (protein <60, WBC <10). Significant CSF pleocytosis (>20 WBC) or markedly elevated protein (>100 mg/dL) should strongly raise concern for PACNS, infection, or carcinomatous meningitis rather than RCVS.

## 3. TREATMENT

### CRITICAL PRIORITIES
1. Identify and DISCONTINUE all vasoconstrictor exposures (triptans, ergots, SSRIs/SNRIs, cannabis, cocaine, sympathomimetics)
2. Control blood pressure (avoid both severe hypertension and hypotension)
3. Start calcium channel blocker (verapamil or nimodipine)
4. Monitor for complications (SAH, ischemic stroke, PRES)
5. Provide analgesic support for thunderclap headaches
6. Serial vascular imaging to confirm resolution

| RCVS typically resolves completely within 12 weeks — follow-up imaging will confirm resolution and guide medication taper | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Complete cessation of all illicit drug use (cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis, ecstasy/MDMA) — these are among the strongest RCVS triggers | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid all vasoconstrictor medications long-term including triptans, ergotamine, and sympathomimetic decongestants — provide patient with written list of medications to avoid | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Blood pressure control target <130/80 mmHg to reduce risk of hemorrhagic and ischemic complications | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Smoking cessation to reduce vascular risk and improve endothelial function | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Caffeine moderation (limit to <200 mg/day) as excessive caffeine may contribute to vasoconstriction | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Stress management and sleep hygiene as physiological stress and sleep deprivation may lower the threshold for vasoconstriction | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Graduated return to exercise starting with light activity (walking, yoga) after 4-6 weeks; avoid heavy resistance training until imaging confirms resolution | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| If postpartum RCVS: discuss recurrence risk with neurologist before future pregnancies; recurrence rate is low (~5-10%) but higher with re-exposure to triggers | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Primary angiitis of the CNS (PACNS) | Progressive headache over weeks (NOT thunderclap); CSF abnormal (pleocytosis >10 WBC, elevated protein >60); vessel wall enhancement on MRI VWI; ESR/CRP often elevated; does NOT resolve spontaneously; requires immunosuppression | CSF analysis (abnormal in PACNS, normal in RCVS); MRI VWI (concentric enhancement in PACNS, absent in RCVS); ESR/CRP (elevated in PACNS); brain biopsy (granulomatous inflammation) |
| Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) | Blood in BASAL CISTERNS (not convexities); aneurysm on CTA/DSA; single thunderclap event; Hunt-Hess grading; requires aneurysm securing | CT (cisternal blood pattern); CTA (aneurysm identified); DSA (gold standard); LP (xanthochromia if CT negative) |
| Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) | May overlap with RCVS (10-40% co-occurrence); seizures and encephalopathy more prominent; bilateral posterior white matter edema on MRI; associated with hypertension, eclampsia, immunosuppressants | MRI (posterior-dominant vasogenic edema); clinical context (hypertension, eclampsia); RCVS and PRES frequently coexist |
| Migraine with aura | Gradual onset aura (over 5-60 min); headache builds over minutes-hours (NOT thunderclap peaking in <60 sec); recurrent stereotyped episodes; normal vascular imaging | Clinical history (gradual onset vs thunderclap); CTA/MRA (normal in migraine; "string of beads" in RCVS) |
| Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) | Subacute headache over days; papilledema; seizures; hemorrhagic venous infarcts; risk factors (OCPs, pregnancy, coagulopathy); thrombosed sinus on MRV | MRV or CT venogram (sinus thrombosis); D-dimer (may be elevated); CSF (elevated pressure) |
| Cervical artery dissection | Neck pain with ipsilateral headache; Horner syndrome; ischemic stroke in single vascular territory (NOT multifocal); intimal flap on CTA | CTA/MRA neck (intimal flap, pseudoaneurysm, mural hematoma); MRI neck with fat sat (crescent sign) |
| Pituitary apoplexy | Sudden headache with visual field defect and ophthalmoplegia; known pituitary adenoma; hemorrhage/infarction within pituitary gland | MRI sella (hemorrhagic/infarcted pituitary mass); hormone panel (panhypopituitarism); visual fields |
| Intracranial hypotension (CSF leak) | Orthostatic headache (worse upright, better supine); may have thunderclap onset; diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement; brain sagging on MRI | MRI (diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, brain sagging, subdural fluid); LP (low opening pressure <6 cm H2O) |
| Hypertensive emergency | Severely elevated BP (>220/120); headache; may have PRES features; no segmental vasoconstriction on vascular imaging | CTA/MRA (no "string of beads"); MRI (may show PRES); BP response to treatment |
| Pheochromocytoma | Paroxysmal hypertension with headache, palpitations, diaphoresis; episodic; adrenal mass | Serum/urine catecholamines and metanephrines; CT/MRI abdomen (adrenal mass) |

## 6. MONITORING PARAMETERS

| Parameter | Frequency | Target/Threshold | Action if Abnormal | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|

| Headache severity and frequency | Daily (inpatient); each visit (outpatient). Use numeric rating scale (0-10) | Decreasing frequency and severity; no new thunderclap episodes | New thunderclap headache: STAT vascular imaging (CTA/MRA) to assess vasoconstriction; escalate therapy | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Serum sodium | Daily x 72h; then q48h; if cerebral edema or SIADH concern | 135-145 mEq/L | Correct hyponatremia cautiously (<10 mEq/24h) | STAT | ROUTINE | - | STAT |

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Disposition | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Discharge home from ED | Generally NOT recommended from ED on initial presentation; RCVS requires inpatient observation to monitor for stroke complications (SAH, ischemic stroke) which may develop over days. Exception: stable patient with mild symptoms, confirmed diagnosis from prior admission, and close neurology follow-up within 48-72 hours |
| Admit to hospital floor | Thunderclap headache with imaging consistent with RCVS; no evidence of ischemic stroke, significant SAH, or PRES; hemodynamically stable; able to take oral medications; no ICU-level monitoring needs |
| Admit to ICU / Step-down | Ischemic stroke complication; significant convexity SAH; PRES with seizures or encephalopathy; need for IV antihypertensives or IV CCB; hemodynamic instability; progressive neurologic deficits; need for endovascular intervention |
| Transfer to higher level of care | If neurointerventional radiology not available and patient has progressive deficits requiring intra-arterial treatment; if neurocritical care not available for complex RCVS with stroke/SAH |
| Discharge from hospital | Headaches controlled on oral CCB; no new thunderclap episodes for >=48 hours; stable neurologic exam; blood pressure controlled; vasoconstrictor triggers identified and discontinued; follow-up neurology appointment scheduled within 1-2 weeks; follow-up imaging (CTA/MRA) scheduled at 4-6 weeks |
| Outpatient follow-up schedule | Neurology 1-2 weeks post-discharge; repeat at 4-6 weeks with interim CTA/MRA; confirmatory CTA/MRA at 8-12 weeks; if complete resolution confirmed, begin CCB taper; final visit after CCB discontinuation |

## APPENDIX A: RCVS DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

**Revised Diagnostic Criteria for RCVS (Calabrese et al. 2007 / Ducros et al. 2012)**

1. Severe, acute headache (usually thunderclap) with or without focal deficits or seizures
2. Uniphasic course without new symptoms >1 month after onset
3. Segmental vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries demonstrated by CTA, MRA, or DSA
4. No evidence of aneurysmal SAH
5. Normal or near-normal CSF (protein <60 mg/dL, WBC <10)
6. Complete or substantial normalization of arteries within 12 weeks of onset

**All 6 criteria support RCVS.** The key confirmatory criterion is resolution of vasoconstriction on follow-up imaging.

## APPENDIX B: RCVS2 SCORE

**RCVS2 Score (Rocha et al. Stroke 2019) — Clinical Prediction Tool**

| Feature | Points |
|---------|--------|
| Recurrent or single thunderclap headache | +5 |
| Intracranial carotid artery involvement | -2 |
| Vasoconstrictive trigger identified | +3 |
| Sex (female) | +1 |
| Subarachnoid hemorrhage present | +1 |

**Interpretation:**

| Score | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| >=5 | Highly likely RCVS (specificity >99%) |
| 2 to 4 | Probable RCVS |
| <2 | Less likely RCVS (consider PACNS or other diagnosis) |

**Clinical Use:** The RCVS2 score can be applied at initial presentation to estimate the probability of RCVS versus PACNS, even before confirmatory follow-up imaging is available. A score >=5 strongly supports initiating RCVS-directed therapy.

## APPENDIX C: COMMON RCVS TRIGGERS

| Category | Specific Triggers |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Serotonergic drugs** | SSRIs (sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram), SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine), triptans (sumatriptan, rizatriptan, all triptans), ergotamine |
| **Sympathomimetic drugs** | Cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine, MDMA/ecstasy, pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, diet pills, energy drinks |
| **Cannabis** | Cannabis (all forms — smoked, edible, concentrate); increasingly recognized trigger |
| **Immunosuppressants** | Cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, interferon-alpha |
| **Other medications** | Bromocriptine, lisuride, nicotine patches, ginseng, ephedra-containing supplements |
| **Postpartum** | Late pregnancy or postpartum period (especially first 2 weeks); with or without eclampsia/preeclampsia |
| **Physiological triggers** | Sexual activity/orgasm, Valsalva maneuver, physical exertion, emotional stress, coughing, sneezing, straining, hot baths/showers |
| **Blood products** | Red blood cell transfusion, IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) |

**Key Point:** In approximately 25-50% of RCVS cases, no trigger is identified (idiopathic). A thorough medication and substance history is essential, but absence of a trigger does NOT exclude the diagnosis.

## APPENDIX D: RCVS vs PACNS — KEY DIFFERENTIATORS

| Feature | RCVS | PACNS |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Headache onset** | Thunderclap (peak in <60 seconds); recurrent over days-weeks | Gradual onset over weeks-months; insidious |
| **Headache pattern** | Multiple thunderclap headaches (hallmark); often trigger-related | Chronic progressive headache; dull, persistent |
| **Clinical course** | Monophasic; resolves in weeks | Progressive without treatment; relapsing |
| **Age/Sex** | Women > Men (3:1); mean age 40-50 | Equal sex distribution; mean age 50-60 |
| **CSF** | Normal or near-normal (WBC <10, protein <60) | Abnormal (pleocytosis, elevated protein >60) |
| **ESR/CRP** | Normal | Often elevated |
| **Vessel wall MRI** | No concentric enhancement | Concentric vessel wall enhancement |
| **Angiography** | Multifocal segmental narrowing; bilateral; reversible | Smooth tapering or beading; may be unilateral; progressive |
| **Resolution** | Complete resolution within 12 weeks | Does NOT resolve spontaneously |
| **Treatment** | CCB + trigger withdrawal; supportive | Immunosuppression (steroids, cyclophosphamide) |
| **Brain biopsy** | Normal | Granulomatous/lymphocytic vasculitis |
| **RCVS2 Score** | >=5 highly specific | <2 favors PACNS |
