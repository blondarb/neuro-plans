# Subacute Combined Degeneration

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** February 11, 2026
**REVISED:** February 11, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Subacute Combined Degeneration of the Spinal Cord

**ICD-10:** E53.8 (Other specified vitamin B deficiencies); G32.0 (Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord in diseases classified elsewhere); D51.9 (Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, unspecified)

**CPT CODES:** 82607 (Vitamin B12 level), 83921 (Methylmalonic acid), 83090 (Homocysteine), 85025 (CBC with differential), 80053 (CMP), 82525 (Copper level), 84630 (Zinc level), 82390 (Ceruloplasmin), 86021 (Intrinsic factor antibodies), 86255 (Anti-parietal cell antibodies), 84443 (TSH), 83036 (HbA1c), 72156 (MRI cervical spine with and without contrast), 72157 (MRI thoracic spine with and without contrast), 70553 (MRI brain with and without contrast), 95907 (NCS), 95886 (EMG), 95925 (SSEPs), 96372 (Therapeutic injection IM), 62270 (Lumbar puncture)

**SYNONYMS:** Subacute combined degeneration, SCD, B12 myelopathy, cobalamin deficiency myelopathy, funicular myelosis, posterior column myelopathy, vitamin B12 deficiency spinal cord disease, combined system disease, subacute combined degeneration of the cord, nitrous oxide myelopathy

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of subacute combined degeneration (SCD) of the spinal cord, focusing on myelopathy from posterior column and lateral corticospinal tract demyelination. Covers B12 deficiency as the primary etiology, with additional coverage of copper deficiency and nitrous oxide toxicity as alternative/contributory causes. Includes diagnostic workup with emphasis on MRI findings, B12 replacement protocols, spasticity management, rehabilitation, and long-term monitoring. Complements the existing B12 Deficiency Neuropathy plan (which focuses on peripheral nerve involvement). Excludes pure peripheral neuropathy without myelopathy and pure hematologic B12 deficiency without neurological involvement.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Subacute Combined Degeneration (SCD):** Demyelination and vacuolar degeneration of the posterior columns (dorsal columns) and lateral corticospinal tracts of the spinal cord, most commonly caused by B12 deficiency; "combined" refers to involvement of both sensory (posterior) and motor (lateral) tracts
- **Inverted V Sign:** Characteristic axial MRI finding showing bilateral symmetric T2 hyperintensity in the posterior columns of the cervical/thoracic spinal cord
- **Lhermitte Sign:** Electric shock-like sensation radiating down the spine or extremities upon neck flexion; indicates posterior column involvement
- **Romberg Sign:** Positive when patient sways or falls with eyes closed but is stable with eyes open; indicates proprioceptive (posterior column) dysfunction
- **Funicular Myelosis:** Historical term for subacute combined degeneration, referring to degeneration of the funiculi (white matter columns) of the spinal cord
- **Methylmalonic Acid (MMA):** Metabolite elevated in B12 deficiency; specific for B12 (not elevated in folate deficiency); elevated MMA confirms tissue-level B12 deficiency even when serum B12 is borderline
- **Pernicious Anemia:** Autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells causing intrinsic factor deficiency and B12 malabsorption; most common cause of severe B12 deficiency leading to SCD

**Combination Therapy Note:** For refractory neuropathic pain, combining agents from different classes (e.g., gabapentinoid + SNRI, or gabapentinoid + TCA) is often more effective than maximizing monotherapy. Avoid combining TCAs with SNRIs (serotonin syndrome risk). Myelopathic pain and spasticity-related pain in SCD often improve with adequate B12 replacement; allow 3-6 months of treatment before concluding symptoms are refractory.

| Do not take folate supplements without B12 as folate alone may correct anemia while allowing neurological damage from SCD to continue progressing silently | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Inform all healthcare providers and anesthesia teams of B12 deficiency before any surgical procedure; nitrous oxide (N2O) used in anesthesia irreversibly oxidizes B12 and can precipitate acute catastrophic neurological deterioration | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| If self-administering B12 injections, use proper IM technique and rotate injection sites (outer thigh or deltoid); attend injection training with nursing before discharge | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Use assistive devices (walker, cane) as recommended by physical therapy for safety during ambulation given impaired proprioception and balance | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Inspect feet daily for cuts, blisters, or wounds using a mirror for soles; impaired sensation from posterior column dysfunction increases injury risk | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Report new numbness, tingling, increasing stiffness, or changes in bladder function to your neurologist as this may indicate inadequate treatment or disease progression | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Do not stop baclofen or other antispasticity medications abruptly as this may cause withdrawal symptoms including seizures and rebound spasticity | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| If nitrous oxide (whippets, laughing gas) was the cause, complete cessation is mandatory as any re-exposure will cause further irreversible spinal cord damage | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Complete alcohol cessation as alcohol independently causes neuropathy, worsens B12 malabsorption, and impairs neurological recovery | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Complete cessation of nitrous oxide use (recreational or occupational) as any exposure causes further irreversible oxidation of B12 and spinal cord damage | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Smoking cessation to improve vascular health, support neural recovery, and reduce risk of gastric malignancy in pernicious anemia patients | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Fall prevention: remove throw rugs, ensure adequate lighting, install grab bars in bathroom, use assistive devices (walker, cane) for sensory ataxia and impaired proprioception | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Dietary sources of B12: meat, fish, eggs, dairy, fortified cereals; copper-rich foods: shellfish, nuts, seeds, organ meats, dark chocolate; supplement if dietary intake insufficient | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| If vegan or vegetarian, lifelong B12 supplementation is required as plant-based diets contain no natural B12 sources | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Regular supervised exercise as tolerated (swimming, stationary bike, seated exercises) to maintain strength and cardiovascular health; avoid exercises requiring intact proprioception without supervision or assistive devices | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid excessive zinc supplementation (>40 mg/day) as zinc competes with copper absorption and can cause copper-deficient myelopathy | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid excessive vitamin B6 supplementation (>100 mg/day) which independently causes peripheral neuropathy and may worsen symptoms | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Annual screening for gastric carcinoid/adenocarcinoma if pernicious anemia confirmed (3-fold increased risk of gastric cancer) | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Review medications for B12-lowering agents: proton pump inhibitors, H2 blockers, metformin, colchicine; dose adjustment or monitoring may be needed | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Metformin users: annual B12 and MMA screening as metformin reduces B12 absorption by 10-30% and may precipitate or worsen SCD | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Home safety evaluation by occupational therapy to identify and eliminate fall hazards given sensory ataxia and proprioceptive loss | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Test bath water temperature with elbow before entering as impaired sensation from posterior column dysfunction increases burn risk | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

## APPENDIX A: SCD Versus B12 Deficiency Neuropathy - Key Differences

| Feature | Subacute Combined Degeneration (SCD) | B12 Deficiency Neuropathy |
|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Primary site** | Spinal cord (posterior columns + lateral corticospinal tracts) | Peripheral nerves |
| **Key symptoms** | Sensory ataxia, spasticity, Lhermitte sign, bladder dysfunction | Burning feet, tingling, numbness, reduced reflexes |
| **Reflexes** | Hyperreflexia (upper motor neuron); may be mixed if concurrent neuropathy | Hyporeflexia or areflexia (lower motor neuron) |
| **Babinski sign** | Present (upgoing toes) | Absent |
| **Romberg sign** | Positive (posterior column dysfunction) | May be positive if severe proprioceptive loss |
| **MRI findings** | Posterior column T2 hyperintensity ("inverted V sign") | Usually normal spinal cord; may show nerve root enhancement |
| **NCS/EMG** | May be normal (pure myelopathy) or show concurrent neuropathy | Axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy; reduced sensory amplitudes |
| **Treatment urgency** | Higher urgency; irreversible damage more likely | Important but less likely to cause permanent disability |
| **Recovery** | Often incomplete; posterior column signs may persist | Better prognosis; paresthesias often improve first |
| **Complementary plan** | This plan | B12 Deficiency Neuropathy plan |

## APPENDIX B: B12 Replacement Dosing Quick Reference for SCD

| Scenario | Route | Induction | Maintenance | Notes |
|----------|-------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| SCD from B12 deficiency (any cause) | IM | 1000 mcg IM daily x 7 days | 1000 mcg IM weekly x 4 weeks, then monthly indefinitely | Preferred initial route for myelopathy; do not delay for lab results |
| SCD from N2O toxicity | IM | Hydroxocobalamin 1000 mcg IM daily x 7 days | 1000 mcg IM monthly indefinitely | Hydroxocobalamin preferred; directly replaces oxidized B12; concurrent N2O cessation mandatory |
| SCD with concurrent copper deficiency | IM + PO | B12 1000 mcg IM daily x 7 days + Copper 2 mg PO TID x 1 week | B12 1000 mcg IM monthly + Copper 2 mg PO daily | Treat both deficiencies simultaneously; monitor both levels |
| Pernicious anemia with SCD | IM | 1000 mcg IM daily x 7 days | 1000 mcg IM monthly indefinitely | Lifelong; cannot absorb oral B12 via IF pathway; gastric surveillance q3-5y |
| Injection-refused or anticoagulated with SCD | PO | 2000 mcg PO daily x 8 weeks | 2000 mcg PO daily indefinitely | NOT first-line for myelopathy; monitor MMA closely at 2-3 months; switch to parenteral if MMA remains elevated |

## APPENDIX C: MRI Findings in SCD

| Finding | Description | Clinical Correlation |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Inverted V sign (axial)** | Bilateral symmetric T2 hyperintensity confined to posterior columns on axial images | Pathognomonic for SCD; reflects demyelination and vacuolar degeneration of dorsal columns |
| **Sagittal pattern** | Longitudinal dorsal T2 hyperintensity spanning multiple segments, typically cervical-thoracic | Length of involvement correlates with severity; may extend from C2 to T12 |
| **Lateral column involvement** | T2 hyperintensity extending into lateral corticospinal tracts | Indicates more advanced disease; correlates with spasticity and UMN signs |
| **Cord swelling** | Mild spinal cord expansion in acute phase | Suggests active inflammation; may respond to corticosteroids in severe cases |
| **Contrast enhancement** | Rare in classic B12 SCD; more common in N2O-induced cases | Suggests active demyelination; consider alternative diagnosis (MS, NMOSD) if prominent |
| **Resolution with treatment** | Signal changes improve or resolve with adequate B12 replacement over 3-12 months | MRI improvement correlates with but may lag behind clinical improvement |
