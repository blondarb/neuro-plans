# Moyamoya Disease

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 31, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Moyamoya Disease

**ICD-10:** I67.5 (Moyamoya disease), I63.9 (Cerebral infarction, unspecified), I61.9 (Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage, unspecified), I67.1 (Cerebral aneurysm, nonruptured), I63.50 (Cerebral infarction due to unspecified occlusion or stenosis of unspecified cerebral artery)

**CPT CODES:** 70553 (MRI brain with/without contrast), 70544-70549 (MRA head/neck), 36224 (cerebral angiography), 70496 (CTA head), 78607 (brain SPECT), 78816 (brain PET), 61711 (STA-MCA bypass), 61624 (EDAS/EMS), 95816 (EEG)

**SYNONYMS:** Moyamoya disease, moyamoya syndrome, moyamoya vasculopathy, spontaneous occlusion of the circle of Willis, progressive intracranial steno-occlusive disease, MMD, quasi-moyamoya, moyamoya angiopathy, puff of smoke disease

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis and management of moyamoya disease and moyamoya syndrome in adults. Covers acute stroke management in moyamoya, diagnostic workup, medical management, surgical revascularization evaluation and options, and long-term monitoring. Distinguishes moyamoya disease (idiopathic, bilateral) from moyamoya syndrome (secondary to other conditions). Excludes pediatric moyamoya (different surgical considerations and natural history) and other causes of ischemic stroke covered in separate templates.

| Outpatient follow-up | Neurology q3-6 months; neurosurgery per surgical timeline; MRA annually; perfusion imaging per protocol |

## CHANGE LOG

**v1.0 (January 31, 2026)**
- Initial template creation
- Comprehensive moyamoya disease/syndrome management covering diagnosis, medical therapy, surgical revascularization (STA-MCA bypass, EDAS, EMS, combined approaches), and long-term monitoring
- Emphasis on critical management principles: hydration, avoid hyperventilation, avoid hypotension

## APPENDIX A: Suzuki Angiographic Staging

| Stage | Angiographic Findings | Clinical Significance |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------|
| I | Narrowing of carotid fork (ICA bifurcation) | Early disease; may be asymptomatic; screening finding |
| II | Initiation of moyamoya collaterals; dilated MCA/ACA branches | Early collateral formation; TIAs may begin |
| III | Intensification of moyamoya collaterals; MCA and ACA further narrowed | "Puff of smoke" appearance maximal; frequent TIAs/strokes |
| IV | Minimization of moyamoya collaterals; PCA involvement begins | Collaterals starting to fail; ECA collaterals develop; higher ischemic risk |
| V | Further reduction of moyamoya; increased ECA collaterals | Major cerebral arteries occluded; reliance on ECA supply |
| VI | Disappearance of moyamoya; complete ICA occlusion; ECA/vertebral supply only | End-stage; entirely dependent on external collaterals; most severe |

## APPENDIX B: Perioperative Management Checklist for Moyamoya Surgery

**Pre-operative:**
- [ ] Adequate hydration (IV fluids starting night before)
- [ ] Aspirin held per neurosurgical guidance (typically 7 days)
- [ ] Hemoglobin optimized (>10 g/dL)
- [ ] Baseline neuropsychological testing completed
- [ ] Anesthesia briefed on: NO hyperventilation, maintain normocapnia (PaCO2 35-40), maintain normotension, adequate IV fluids, avoid hypothermia

**Intra-operative:**
- [ ] PaCO2 35-40 mmHg (NEVER hyperventilate; avoid PaCO2 <35)
- [ ] MAP maintained at or above patient's baseline (avoid hypotension)
- [ ] Temperature 36-37°C (normothermia)
- [ ] Adequate IV hydration (replace insensible + blood loss)
- [ ] Avoid vasoconstrictive agents

**Post-operative:**
- [ ] ICU for 24-48h minimum
- [ ] BP strictly monitored (avoid hypo- AND hypertension; target ±10% of baseline)
- [ ] Aggressive IV hydration (150-200 mL/h)
- [ ] Pain control (avoid hyperventilation from pain-induced crying)
- [ ] Neuro checks q1h x 24h
- [ ] CT head if any new deficit
- [ ] TCD daily x 3 days (bypass patency)
- [ ] Resume aspirin 24-48h post-op per surgeon
- [ ] Avoid fever (increases metabolic demand)
- [ ] Encourage calm environment (minimize stress/agitation)
