## NOTES

- Diabetic neuropathy is the most common cause of neuropathy in developed countries
- DSPN affects up to 50% of diabetic patients; often asymptomatic initially
- Early detection through annual screening (monofilament, tuning fork) is critical
- Glycemic control is the ONLY intervention proven to prevent DPN progression (especially Type 1)
- Multifactorial risk reduction (glucose, lipids, BP, weight) provides best outcomes
- Painful DPN: Start with duloxetine or pregabalin/gabapentin; combination therapy often needed
- Avoid opioids if possible due to dependence risk; use only for refractory cases
- Metformin-associated B12 deficiency is common; screen and supplement
- Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy increases mortality risk; screen high-risk patients
- Diabetic amyotrophy is self-limited (months to years) but painful; immunotherapy controversial
- Foot care education and proper footwear are essential to prevent amputations
- Annual comprehensive foot exam for ALL diabetic patients
