---

## APPENDIX B: Genetic Counseling Considerations

### Pre-Test Counseling Essentials

1. **Implications of positive result:** Progressive, fatal disease with no cure; 50% risk to offspring
2. **Implications of negative result:** No increased risk, but survivor guilt possible
3. **Intermediate alleles (27-35 repeats):** Not affected, but may expand in offspring
4. **Reduced penetrance (36-39 repeats):** May or may not develop HD; difficult counseling
5. **Full penetrance (40+ repeats):** Will develop HD if lives long enough
6. **Insurance and discrimination:** GINA protects health insurance and employment; does NOT cover life, disability, or long-term care insurance
7. **Timeline:** Results typically 2-4 weeks; follow-up support essential

### Testing of At-Risk Individuals

- Minimum age 18 for predictive testing (legal adult)
- Do not test minors unless symptomatic
- Recommended: 2+ counseling sessions before testing
- Wait period between disclosure and decision
- Support system should be in place before results

### Prenatal Testing Options

1. **Prenatal diagnosis:** CVS at 10-12 weeks or amniocentesis at 15-20 weeks

## APPENDIX C: End-of-Life Planning

### Advance Directive Considerations Specific to HD

| Issue | Considerations |
|-------|----------------|
| Feeding tubes | PEG may prolong survival but not necessarily quality of life; discuss before capacity lost |
| Mechanical ventilation | Usually not consistent with comfort goals in end-stage HD |
| Antibiotic use | Consider limiting to comfort measures in advanced disease |
| Hospitalization | May prefer comfort care at home or hospice facility |
| Autopsy/brain donation | Important for research; discuss while patient can consent |

### Hospice Eligibility Criteria (General Guidance)

- TFC Stage 5 (Total Functional Capacity score 0)
- Unable to ambulate without substantial assistance
- Unable to communicate intelligibly
- Recurrent aspiration pneumonia
- PPS (Palliative Performance Scale) ≤50%
