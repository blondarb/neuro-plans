# Neurosarcoidosis

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** January 30, 2026
**REVISED:** January 30, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Neurosarcoidosis

**ICD-10:** D86.82 (Sarcoid meningitis), D86.89 (Sarcoidosis of other sites), D86.9 (Sarcoidosis, unspecified), G53 (Cranial nerve disorders in diseases classified elsewhere)

**SYNONYMS:** Neurosarcoidosis, neurosarcoid, CNS sarcoidosis, sarcoid neuropathy, sarcoid meningitis, sarcoid myelopathy, sarcoid cranial neuropathy, sarcoid optic neuropathy, granulomatous meningitis, sarcoid hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, sarcoid hydrocephalus, sarcoid mass lesion, neuro-sarcoid, sarcoidosis with nervous system involvement, central nervous system sarcoidosis

**SCOPE:** Diagnostic workup and management of suspected or confirmed neurosarcoidosis across all neurological presentations: cranial neuropathies, aseptic meningitis, hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, hydrocephalus, and mass lesions. Covers Zajicek diagnostic criteria (definite, probable, possible), acute immunotherapy, steroid-sparing agents, and long-term immunosuppression. For isolated pulmonary or systemic sarcoidosis without neurological involvement, defer to pulmonology. For other granulomatous CNS diseases (e.g., granulomatosis with polyangiitis, TB meningitis), use respective templates.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Definite Neurosarcoidosis (Zajicek criteria):** Biopsy of nervous system tissue demonstrating non-caseating granulomas, with other causes excluded
- **Probable Neurosarcoidosis:** CNS inflammation (elevated CSF protein/cells, MRI abnormalities, or positive brain/spine biopsy consistent with neurosarcoidosis) PLUS evidence of systemic sarcoidosis (biopsy-confirmed)
- **Possible Neurosarcoidosis:** Clinical and MRI findings suggestive of neurosarcoidosis without tissue confirmation of systemic or nervous system sarcoidosis

### LUMBAR PUNCTURE

**Indication:** Essential for diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis; CSF abnormalities support diagnosis (lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, low glucose); CSF ACE level; rules out infectious meningitis (TB, fungal, bacterial); rules out CNS lymphoma and carcinomatous meningitis

**Timing:** URGENT in ED/hospital setting; ROUTINE for outpatient workup. Perform after CT head to rule out mass effect/hydrocephalus

**Volume Required:** 15-20 mL (sufficient for comprehensive infectious, inflammatory, and cytology studies)

## CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT NOTES

### Zajicek Diagnostic Criteria for Neurosarcoidosis

**Definite Neurosarcoidosis:**
- [ ] Nervous system biopsy demonstrating non-caseating granulomas
- [ ] Other causes of granulomatous inflammation excluded (TB, fungal, foreign body)

**Probable Neurosarcoidosis:**
- [ ] Evidence of CNS inflammation (CSF abnormalities: elevated protein, pleocytosis, oligoclonal bands) AND/OR MRI abnormalities consistent with neurosarcoidosis AND/OR positive brain/spine biopsy
- [ ] Evidence of systemic sarcoidosis confirmed by tissue biopsy (lung, lymph node, skin, etc.)
- [ ] Other causes excluded

**Possible Neurosarcoidosis:**
- [ ] Clinical and/or MRI features suggestive of neurosarcoidosis
- [ ] No tissue confirmation of sarcoidosis (systemic or nervous system)
- [ ] Other causes excluded to the extent possible

### Updated Stern/Sarcoidosis Consortium Criteria (2018)

- **Type 1 (Definite):** Nervous system pathology consistent with neurosarcoidosis + exclusion of other causes
- **Type 2 (Probable):** Systemic biopsy-proven sarcoidosis + typical neurological syndrome + exclusion of other causes
- **Type 3 (Possible):** Typical neurological syndrome + no tissue confirmation + exclusion of other causes

### Common Presentations of Neurosarcoidosis

| Presentation | Frequency | Key Features |
|-------------|-----------|-------------- |
| Cranial neuropathy | 50-70% | CN VII (facial palsy) most common; CN II (optic neuropathy) second; may be bilateral; any CN can be involved |
| Aseptic meningitis | 10-25% | Headache, meningismus; CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis; may be chronic/relapsing |
| Hypothalamic-pituitary | 5-15% | Diabetes insipidus; hyperprolactinemia; central hypothyroidism; hypogonadism; SIADH |
| Myelopathy | 5-10% | Subacute; thoracic predominance; dorsal subpial enhancement; may mimic MS or NMOSD |
| Hydrocephalus | 5-10% | Communicating (meningeal) or obstructive; may require VP shunt |
| Mass lesion (granuloma) | 5-10% | Mimics tumor; dural-based or parenchymal; may cause seizures, focal deficits |
| Peripheral neuropathy | 15-40% | Small fiber neuropathy (most common); mononeuritis multiplex; polyradiculopathy |
| Seizures | 5-10% | From cortical/meningeal involvement; may be presenting feature |
| Cognitive/psychiatric | 5-20% | Memory impairment; confusion; depression; personality changes |

### Red Flags Suggesting Neurosarcoidosis

- [ ] Bilateral facial nerve palsy (especially in young African American patient)
- [ ] Cranial neuropathy + bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest imaging
- [ ] Chronic meningitis with lymphocytic pleocytosis + elevated CSF ACE
- [ ] Diabetes insipidus + hypothalamic/pituitary stalk enhancement on MRI
- [ ] Leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI (especially basilar) + systemic sarcoidosis
- [ ] Optic neuropathy + hilar adenopathy + elevated serum ACE
- [ ] Myelopathy with dorsal subpial enhancement ("trident sign") on spine MRI
- [ ] Small fiber neuropathy with multisystem granulomatous disease
- [ ] Erythema nodosum or lupus pernio + new neurological symptoms

### Scadding Staging (Chest Imaging)

| Stage | Findings | Frequency in Sarcoidosis |
|-------|----------|--------------------------|
| 0 | Normal chest imaging | 5-10% |
| I | Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL) only | ~50% |
| II | BHL + pulmonary infiltrates | ~25% |
| III | Pulmonary infiltrates without BHL | ~15% |
| IV | Pulmonary fibrosis | ~5% |

## CHANGE LOG

**v1.1 (January 30, 2026)**
- Checker/Rebuilder pipeline: validated against 6 quality domains; applied all approved revisions
- R6: Reordered ALL lab tables (1A, 1B, 1C) and imaging tables (2A, 2B, 2C) and LP table to place venue columns (ED/HOSP/OPD/ICU) as last 4 columns per style guide CSS requirements
- R1: Standardized structured dosing format across ALL treatment sections (3A, 3B, 3C, 3D) to use `[dose] :: [route] :: [frequency] :: [full_instructions]` with exactly 4 fields
- R2: Cleaned up Route column in all treatment tables to show single primary route instead of multi-route (e.g., "IV" instead of "IV/SC/IN")
- R3: Split testosterone replacement into two separate rows (testosterone cypionate IM and testosterone gel topical) for proper order sentence generation
- R5/R8: Added ICU column to Section 4B (Patient Instructions) and Section 4C (Lifestyle & Prevention) for 4-column venue consistency
- M1-M4: Fixed structured dosing format across all treatment rows -- each now has standard_dose, route, frequency, and full_instructions fields
- Updated version to 1.1; added REVISED date
- No clinical content changes; all medication dosing and clinical recommendations unchanged

**v1.0 (January 30, 2026)**
