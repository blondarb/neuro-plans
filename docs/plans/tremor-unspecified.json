Covers the systematic approach to tremor classification (rest, postural, kinetic, intention, task-specific), differentiation of essential tremor, Parkinson tremor, enhanced physiologic tremor, drug-induced tremor, cerebellar tremor, Holmes (rubral) tremor, dystonic tremor, and psychogenic (functional) tremor. Includes DaTscan indications, laboratory workup (thyroid, Wilson disease, medication review), and empiric treatment while awaiting definitive diagnosis. Settings: ED, HOSP, OPD. Excludes definitive management of established diagnoses (see Essential Tremor, Parkinson's Disease, Drug-Induced Parkinsonism, Dystonia, Functional Neurological Disorder templates for ongoing management after diagnosis confirmed).",
