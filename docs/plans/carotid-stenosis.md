### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Learn and recognize stroke warning signs (FAST: Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call 911); call 911 immediately if any symptom occurs — do not wait to see if symptoms resolve | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Take all medications as prescribed including aspirin, statin, and blood pressure medications every day; DO NOT stop antiplatelet medication without consulting your neurologist or surgeon — stopping these medications significantly increases stroke risk | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| If scheduled for CEA or CAS, take aspirin the morning of surgery unless told otherwise; inform your surgeon of all blood thinners including over-the-counter medications and supplements | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| After CEA surgery, report immediately: new weakness, numbness, speech difficulty, vision changes, severe headache, neck swelling, or difficulty breathing (may indicate stroke, neck hematoma, or hyperperfusion syndrome) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| After CAS procedure, report immediately: new neurologic symptoms, groin swelling or bleeding at catheter site, chest pain, or severe headache | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Monitor blood pressure at home twice daily (morning and evening) using validated automatic cuff; keep a log and bring to all appointments; target <130/80 if symptomatic, <140/90 if asymptomatic | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Attend all scheduled follow-up carotid ultrasound appointments; surveillance imaging detects progression or restenosis early when intervention is most effective | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Do not drive until cleared by your neurologist if you have had a TIA or stroke; driving restrictions vary by state but typically require 3-6 months seizure-free and stable neurologically | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Smoking cessation is the single most important lifestyle modification for carotid stenosis; reduces progression of atherosclerosis and perioperative complications; offer nicotine replacement, varenicline, or bupropion; referral to cessation program | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Mediterranean-style or DASH diet: rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, olive oil; limit sodium to <2300 mg/day (1500 mg if hypertensive); limit processed foods and red meat; dietary pattern reduces atherosclerosis progression | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Regular aerobic exercise: 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (brisk walking, swimming, cycling) at least 5 days per week; exercise improves endothelial function and reduces cardiovascular events by 20-25% | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Limit alcohol to <=1 drink/day for women, <=2 drinks/day for men; heavy alcohol consumption increases blood pressure and stroke risk; complete abstinence preferred if poorly controlled hypertension | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Weight management: target BMI 18.5-25; waist circumference <40 inches (men) / <35 inches (women); even modest weight loss (5-10%) improves blood pressure, lipids, and glucose control | - | - | ROUTINE |
| Diabetes management: target HbA1c <7% (individualize for elderly); strict glycemic control slows carotid intima-media thickness progression; regular glucose monitoring and medication adherence | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Stress management and adequate sleep (7-9 hours nightly); chronic stress and sleep deprivation contribute to hypertension and atherosclerosis; screen for obstructive sleep apnea (STOP-BANG questionnaire) | - | - | ROUTINE |

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis | Stenosis of intracranial arteries (MCA, basilar, intracranial ICA); different treatment approach (SAMMPRIS showed medical > stenting for intracranial stenosis); may coexist with extracranial disease | CTA/MRA head (intracranial vessels); TCD with intracranial velocities; distinguish from extracranial disease on vascular imaging |
| Carotid dissection | Younger patients; history of trauma or neck manipulation; sudden headache or neck pain; Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis); mural hematoma on imaging; not atherosclerotic | CTA/MRA neck (intramural hematoma, string sign, dissection flap); fat-saturated T1 MRI neck (crescent sign); typically anticoagulate or antiplatelet rather than revascularize |
| Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) | Younger women; "string of beads" appearance on imaging; may affect renal arteries concurrently; non-atherosclerotic; higher dissection risk | CTA/MRA (beaded appearance); screen for renal FMD; genetic counseling; antiplatelet therapy; rarely requires surgical intervention |
| Takayasu arteritis | Young women (<40); large vessel vasculitis; systemic inflammation (elevated ESR/CRP); may cause carotid stenosis or occlusion; pulses absent or diminished | ESR, CRP (elevated); CTA/MRA (long-segment stenosis, wall thickening); PET/CT (active inflammation); treat with immunosuppression not surgical revascularization in active phase |
| Giant cell arteritis (GCA) | Age >50; headache; jaw claudication; PMR symptoms; elevated ESR/CRP; can cause extracranial carotid and vertebral stenosis | ESR (>50), CRP; temporal artery biopsy; CTA/MRA (long-segment smooth stenosis vs focal atherosclerotic plaque); treat with high-dose steroids |
| Radiation-induced carotid stenosis | History of prior head/neck radiation therapy; delayed stenosis years-decades after radiation; diffuse and often long-segment stenosis; higher restenosis rates; CAS often preferred over CEA | Clinical history of prior radiation; CTA/MRA (long-segment stenosis in radiation field); tissue fibrosis makes CEA technically difficult; CAS preferred |
| Carotid web (intimal variant of FMD) | Thin shelf-like intraluminal filling defect; typically at posterior wall of carotid bulb; young patient with cryptogenic stroke; not true atherosclerotic stenosis | CTA neck with thin cuts (shelf-like filling defect at posterior bulb); often missed on ultrasound; treatment: antiplatelet vs surgical web resection for recurrent events |
| Carotid body tumor (paraganglioma) | Pulsatile neck mass; splaying of ICA and ECA on imaging ("lyre sign"); may cause compression or displacement of carotid but not atherosclerotic stenosis | CTA/MRA (enhancing mass at carotid bifurcation with vessel splaying); plasma metanephrines; surgical excision if symptomatic |
| Cardioembolic stroke (without significant carotid disease) | AF or structural heart disease as primary stroke etiology; carotid imaging shows <50% stenosis; embolic infarct pattern on MRI; treatment is anticoagulation not CEA | ECG, Holter, echocardiogram (AF, LV thrombus, valvular vegetation); carotid duplex (<50% stenosis); management with anticoagulation rather than antiplatelet/revascularization |

## APPENDIX A: Carotid Stenosis Grading by Duplex Ultrasound (NASCET-Equivalent)

| Stenosis Category | Peak Systolic Velocity (PSV) | End-Diastolic Velocity (EDV) | ICA/CCA PSV Ratio | Management Implications |
|-------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Normal (<50%) | <125 cm/s | <40 cm/s | <2.0 | Medical therapy alone |
| Moderate (50-69%) | 125-230 cm/s | 40-100 cm/s | 2.0-4.0 | Medical therapy; CEA if symptomatic with favorable anatomy and low perioperative risk |
| Severe (70-99%) | >230 cm/s | >100 cm/s | >4.0 | CEA/CAS strongly recommended if symptomatic (within 2 weeks); consider CEA if asymptomatic with life expectancy >5 years and perioperative risk <3% |
| Near-occlusion | Variable (may be low or high) | Variable | Variable | Variable velocities; string sign on CTA/MRA; angiography may be needed; CEA benefit uncertain (post-hoc NASCET analysis); individualize |
| Total occlusion | No detectable flow | No detectable flow | N/A | No CEA/CAS indicated; medical therapy only; evaluate contralateral carotid; consider EC-IC bypass only if hemodynamic compromise (elevated OEF on PET) |

**Notes:**
- Duplex criteria may vary between vascular laboratories; use laboratory-specific validated criteria
- Confirm with CTA or MRA when stenosis grade will change management
- NASCET method measures stenosis relative to normal distal ICA (not carotid bulb)

---

## APPENDIX B: Symptomatic vs Asymptomatic Decision Framework

**Symptomatic carotid stenosis** is defined as:

- Ipsilateral stroke or TIA within the preceding **6 months** (some guidelines use 3-6 months)
- Symptoms must be referable to the territory of the stenotic carotid artery (hemisphere symptoms: contralateral motor/sensory deficit, aphasia if left, neglect if right; retinal symptoms: amaurosis fugax = transient monocular visual loss ipsilateral to stenosis)

**Asymptomatic carotid stenosis** includes:

- No ipsilateral cerebrovascular events in the preceding 6 months
- Incidentally discovered stenosis (cervical bruit, screening imaging)
- Contralateral symptoms only (stenosis on the opposite side is "asymptomatic")

**High-risk features in asymptomatic stenosis** (may favor intervention):

- Silent ipsilateral infarcts on MRI brain (DWI or FLAIR)
- Stenosis progression on serial duplex (e.g., from 60% to 80% over 12 months)
- Microembolic signals detected on TCD monitoring
- Contralateral carotid occlusion (higher ipsilateral stroke risk)
- Ulcerated or echolucent plaque on duplex
- Intraplaque hemorrhage on dedicated carotid MRI
- Male sex (higher annual stroke risk than female in ACAS/ACST)

**Medical therapy alone may be preferred when:**

- Life expectancy <5 years (will not realize surgical benefit)
- Multiple severe comorbidities increasing perioperative risk
- Perioperative stroke/death risk >3% (asymptomatic) or >6% (symptomatic) at the local center
- Patient preference after informed shared decision-making
- Contemporary optimal medical therapy achieves annual stroke risk <1% for many asymptomatic patients

---

## APPENDIX C: Hyperperfusion Syndrome Post-Revascularization

**Definition:** Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome occurs when restored blood flow to a chronically hypoperfused hemisphere exceeds autoregulatory capacity, typically 1-14 days post-CEA or post-CAS.

**Incidence:** 1-3% after CEA; slightly higher after CAS

**Risk factors:**

- Severe stenosis (>90%) or near-occlusion
- Poor collateral circulation
- Contralateral occlusion
- Intraoperative hypertension
- Pre-existing hypertension poorly controlled
- Recent ipsilateral stroke

**Clinical presentation:**

- Severe ipsilateral headache (most common early sign)
- Focal seizures (often motor)
- Focal neurologic deficits (may mimic stroke)
- Intracerebral hemorrhage (most feared complication; mortality up to 50%)

**Management:**

1. **Strict BP control**: Target SBP <120-140 (or at/below preoperative baseline); nicardipine or labetalol drip
2. **Seizure management**: Levetiracetam if seizure occurs; prophylactic anticonvulsants not routinely recommended
3. **Avoid antiplatelet/anticoagulant escalation** if hemorrhage suspected
4. **Emergent CT head** to evaluate for intracerebral hemorrhage
5. **ICU monitoring** with continuous arterial line and frequent neuro checks
