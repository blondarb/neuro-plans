## 3. TREATMENT

**CRITICAL:** Meningioma management depends on WHO grade, tumor size, location, symptoms, patient age, and comorbidities. Many meningiomas (especially small, asymptomatic, incidental WHO grade I) are managed with observation and serial imaging. Treatment decisions require multidisciplinary coordination (neurosurgery, radiation oncology, neuro-oncology for atypical/malignant grades).

| Primary CNS lymphoma (dural) | Rare dural presentation; homogeneous enhancement; restricted diffusion on DWI; may respond dramatically to corticosteroids; immunocompromised patients at higher risk | DWI showing restricted diffusion; CSF flow cytometry; stereotactic biopsy; HIV testing; typically B-cell markers positive; avoid steroids before biopsy |

## APPENDIX A: SIMPSON GRADING SYSTEM FOR MENINGIOMA RESECTION

```
SIMPSON GRADE    DESCRIPTION                                           5-YEAR RECURRENCE
     I           Complete removal including resection of               ~5%
                 dural attachment and abnormal bone

     II          Complete removal with coagulation                     ~10%
                 (not resection) of dural attachment

     III         Complete removal WITHOUT resection or                 ~15-20%
                 coagulation of dural attachment or
                 extradural extensions (e.g., invaded sinus)

     IV          Subtotal resection (partial removal)                  ~40%

     V           Simple decompression (biopsy only)                    ~50-60%
```

**Clinical Decision Making Based on Simpson Grade:**
- **Simpson I-II:** Observation with serial MRI (annual for grade I tumors)
- **Simpson III:** Consider adjuvant SRS/RT especially if WHO grade II/III
- **Simpson IV-V:** Adjuvant SRS/RT generally recommended; re-resection if symptomatic progression

## APPENDIX C: MENINGIOMA LOCATION-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

| Location | Frequency | Key Surgical Considerations | Symptoms | Special Studies |
|----------|-----------|---------------------------|----------|-----------------|
| Convexity | ~20-25% | Most surgically accessible; Simpson I often achievable; seizure risk highest | Seizures; focal deficits; headache | Standard MRI sufficient |
| Parasagittal / Falcine | ~20-25% | Sagittal sinus invasion common; MRV essential; complete resection may sacrifice sinus; staged surgery may be needed | Leg weakness (bilateral if parasagittal); seizures | MRV mandatory; consider venous phase DSA |
| Sphenoid wing | ~15-20% | Medial (clinoidal) most challenging; lateral more accessible; ICA/MCA encasement risk; cavernous sinus invasion | Proptosis (en plaque); visual loss; CN III/IV/VI palsies | CTA/MRA; orbital MRI; visual fields |
| Skull base (general) | ~25-30% | Complex approaches; cranial nerve preservation critical; GTR often not possible; SRS excellent alternative | CN deficits; headache; CSF leak risk | CTA/DSA; audiometry; visual fields |
| Olfactory groove | ~8-10% | Bilateral frontal approach; Foster Kennedy syndrome; anosmia often pre-existing | Anosmia; personality changes; papilledema | Visual fields; neuropsych testing |
| Tuberculum sellae | ~5-8% | Visual apparatus proximity; endoscopic endonasal approach gaining favor | Visual loss (bilateral); chiasmal compression | Visual fields; pituitary hormones |
| CPA (Cerebellopontine angle) | ~5-8% | CN VII/VIII preservation; differentiate from vestibular schwannoma | Hearing loss; tinnitus; facial weakness; ataxia | Audiometry; ABR; MRI IAC protocol |
| Posterior fossa / Foramen magnum | ~5-10% | Vertebral artery proximity; CN IX-XII at risk; prone or lateral position | Lower CN deficits; dysphagia; ataxia; myelopathy | CTA; MRI craniocervical junction |
| Petroclival | ~5% | Most surgically challenging; CN V/VI risk; near brainstem; often subtotal resection; SRS for residual | CN V/VI palsies; hearing loss; ataxia | CTA/DSA; audiometry; ABR |
| Intraventricular | ~1-2% | Choroid plexus origin; highly vascular; surgical approach through brain parenchyma | Hydrocephalus; headache; papilledema | Pre-op embolization if feasible |
