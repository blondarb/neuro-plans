# Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** February 11, 2026
**REVISED:** February 11, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome

**ICD-10:** F10.96 (Alcohol use, unspecified with alcohol-induced persisting amnestic disorder), F10.26 (Alcohol dependence with alcohol-induced persisting amnestic disorder), E51.2 (Wernicke encephalopathy)

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome including the chronic Korsakoff amnestic component, differentiation from isolated Wernicke encephalopathy, long-term cognitive rehabilitation, and nutritional management. Covers transition from acute Wernicke encephalopathy to chronic Korsakoff syndrome, cognitive assessment, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions for memory impairment, behavioral management, and disposition planning. Applies to ED (acute decompensation/re-presentation), HOSP (initial stabilization and workup), OPD (long-term management and rehabilitation), and ICU (severe cases with hemodynamic or respiratory compromise). For acute Wernicke encephalopathy management, see the dedicated Wernicke Encephalopathy plan.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Wernicke Encephalopathy (WE):** Acute neuropsychiatric syndrome from thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency; classically presents with triad of encephalopathy, oculomotor dysfunction, and ataxia
- **Korsakoff Syndrome (KS):** Chronic amnestic syndrome characterized by severe anterograde amnesia, retrograde amnesia, confabulation, apathy, and executive dysfunction following inadequately treated WE
- **Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome (WKS):** The combined acute-to-chronic continuum of thiamine deficiency brain injury encompassing both WE and subsequent KS
- **Confabulation:** Production of fabricated or distorted memories without deliberate deception; characteristic of Korsakoff syndrome
- **Diencephalic Amnesia:** Memory impairment resulting from damage to mammillary bodies and medial thalamic nuclei; the neuroanatomic basis of Korsakoff syndrome

## CLINICAL FEATURES

**Korsakoff Syndrome - Core Features:**
1. **Severe anterograde amnesia:** Inability to form new memories; most prominent and disabling feature
2. **Retrograde amnesia:** Loss of previously formed memories, typically with temporal gradient (remote memories relatively preserved)
3. **Confabulation:** Spontaneous or provoked production of false memories without awareness; more prominent early in disease course
4. **Apathy and lack of insight:** Patients often unaware of deficits; reduced motivation and emotional flatness
5. **Executive dysfunction:** Impaired planning, set-shifting, and problem-solving; frontal lobe involvement

**Relatively Preserved Functions:**
- General intelligence (IQ)
- Procedural/implicit memory (can learn motor tasks)
- Semantic memory (general knowledge)
- Immediate memory (digit span)
- Social skills and conversation (may mask deficits)

**Neuroanatomic Basis:**
- Mammillary body atrophy (most consistent finding)
- Anterior thalamic nuclei damage (mediodorsal nucleus)
- Frontal cortical atrophy (contributes to executive dysfunction)
- Hippocampal involvement (variable)
- Cerebellar vermis atrophy (correlates with ataxia)

**Recovery Prognosis:**
- ~25% show significant improvement with adequate thiamine and abstinence
- ~25% show some improvement
- ~25% remain stable
- ~25% continue to deteriorate (especially with continued alcohol use)
- Oculomotor symptoms recover first (hours to days)
- Ataxia improves partially over weeks to months
- Memory deficits are most resistant to recovery

## NOTES

- Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a CONTINUUM: Wernicke encephalopathy is the acute phase; Korsakoff syndrome is the chronic sequela of inadequately treated WE
- Korsakoff syndrome is largely IRREVERSIBLE once established, but progression can be halted with thiamine replacement and alcohol abstinence
- Approximately 80% of patients with untreated WE develop Korsakoff syndrome; early aggressive thiamine treatment is the best prevention
- The hallmark of KS is DISPROPORTIONATE AMNESIA relative to other cognitive domains; patients may appear conversationally normal despite profound memory impairment
- Confabulation is a SYMPTOM of the disease, not deliberate deception; educate families and caregivers
- Procedural (implicit) memory is relatively preserved; this is the basis for rehabilitation strategies (errorless learning, spaced retrieval)
- Oral thiamine has LIMITED bioavailability in patients with alcohol use disorder; parenteral (IV or IM) route is essential during acute treatment and when compliance is uncertain
- Magnesium must be repleted CONCURRENTLY with thiamine, as it is a required cofactor for thiamine-dependent enzymes
- Patients with KS often cannot reliably self-administer medications due to anterograde amnesia; supervised medication management is essential
- Long-term residential placement may be necessary for patients with severe KS who cannot live independently
- Cognitive rehabilitation using errorless learning techniques shows the most promise for functional improvement
- Regular assessment with standardized tools (MoCA, formal neuropsychological testing) is essential to track trajectory and guide management
- For acute Wernicke encephalopathy management protocols, refer to the dedicated Wernicke Encephalopathy plan

## APPENDIX A: Cognitive Rehabilitation Techniques for Korsakoff Syndrome

| Technique | Description | Evidence | Application |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Errorless learning | Prevent errors during learning by providing correct response; avoids encoding of incorrect information | Class II, Level B | Teach daily routines, medication names, caregiver names; provide immediate cues |
| Spaced retrieval | Gradually increasing intervals between memory tests; leverages preserved implicit memory | Class II, Level B | Practice retrieving important information (medication schedule, safety rules) at expanding intervals |
| External memory aids | Calendars, notebooks, phone reminders, labeled photographs, whiteboards | Expert consensus | Implement early; train patient and caregiver; place in consistent locations |
| Environmental structuring | Fixed routines, consistent layout, labeled spaces, simplified choices | Expert consensus | Reduce cognitive demand; allow procedural learning of routines |
| Vanishing cues | Gradually reduce prompts/cues as learning consolidates | Class III, Level C | Use for learning names, routes, task sequences |
| Music-based interventions | Leverage preserved musical memory for mood, engagement, and contextual recall | Class III, Level C | Background music during activities; singing familiar songs; rhythmic cuing for gait |

## APPENDIX B: Functional Capacity Assessment Guide

| Domain | Assessment Tool | Key Questions | Implications for Disposition |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| Memory | MoCA memory subscore; RBMT (Rivermead) | Can patient remember to take medications? Can patient recall appointments? | If unable to manage medications independently, requires supervised administration |
| Orientation | MoCA orientation; serial assessments | Is patient consistently oriented to place, time, person? | Persistent disorientation suggests need for structured environment |
| Executive function | Trail Making B; verbal fluency; clock drawing | Can patient plan meals, manage finances, problem-solve? | Executive impairment limits independence even if memory partially preserved |
| Safety judgment | Structured interview; occupational therapy home assessment | Can patient respond to emergencies? Is patient a wandering risk? | Poor safety judgment requires 24-hour supervision |
| ADL independence | Barthel Index; Katz ADL; FIM | Can patient dress, bathe, toilet, eat independently? | ADL dependence guides level of care (home aide vs. residential vs. SNF) |
| Instrumental ADLs | Lawton IADL scale | Can patient manage medications, finances, transportation, cooking? | IADL impairment is often the limiting factor for independent living |
