# Anoxic Brain Injury / Neuroprognostication

**VERSION:** 1.2
**CREATED:** January 30, 2026
**REVISED:** February 12, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Anoxic Brain Injury / Neuroprognostication

**ICD-10:** G93.1 (Anoxic brain damage, not elsewhere classified), G93.82 (Brain death), I46.9 (Cardiac arrest, cause unspecified), I46.2 (Cardiac arrest due to underlying cardiac condition), I46.8 (Cardiac arrest due to other underlying condition), G93.6 (Cerebral edema), G40.901 (Epilepsy with status epilepticus — post-anoxic seizures), G25.3 (Myoclonus — post-anoxic myoclonus)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC with differential), 80053 (CMP (BMP + LFTs)), 82803 (Arterial blood gas (ABG)), 83605 (Lactate), 84484 (Troponin (serial)), 85610 (PT/INR), 85384 (Fibrinogen), 82947 (Blood glucose), 83735 (Magnesium), 82330 (Calcium, ionized), 84100 (Phosphorus), 84703 (Pregnancy test (beta-hCG)), 86900 (Blood type and screen), 80307 (Urine drug screen), 80320 (Blood alcohol level), 83519 (Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE)), 85379 (D-dimer), 84145 (Procalcitonin), 82533 (Cortisol (AM)), 84443 (TSH), 83880 (BNP / NT-proBNP), 82140 (Ammonia), 83930 (Serum osmolality), 83036 (HbA1c), 80061 (Lipid panel), 82375 (Carboxyhemoglobin), 70450 (CT head without contrast), 93000 (ECG (12-lead)), 71046 (Chest X-ray), 93458 (Coronary angiography / cardiac catheterization), 95700 (Continuous EEG (cEEG)), 93306 (Echocardiogram (TTE)), 70553 (MRI brain with DWI/ADC), 95925 (SSEP (somatosensory evoked potentials)), 76390 (MR spectroscopy), 75557 (Cardiac MRI), 75574 (CT angiography coronary), 93620 (Electrophysiology study (EPS)), 78608 (PET brain (FDG))

**SYNONYMS:** Anoxic brain injury, ABI, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, HIE, post-cardiac arrest syndrome, PCAS, post-cardiac arrest brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, cerebral anoxia, global cerebral ischemia, post-arrest encephalopathy, cardiac arrest brain injury, neuroprognostication, post-resuscitation care, anoxic brain damage, hypoxic brain injury, cerebral hypoxia, post-cardiac arrest care, return of spontaneous circulation, ROSC, comatose survivor of cardiac arrest, post-anoxic myoclonus, Lance-Adams syndrome

**SCOPE:** Acute management, targeted temperature management (TTM), neuroprognostication, and rehabilitation pathway for anoxic brain injury following cardiac arrest or other causes of global cerebral hypoxia in adults. Covers post-cardiac arrest care bundle (TTM 32-36C for 24h, hemodynamic optimization, seizure management), multimodal neuroprognostication (clinical exam, EEG, SSEP, MRI, biomarkers, CT), confounder identification and elimination, myoclonus classification, and rehabilitation pathway for survivors. Excludes neonatal HIE, pediatric cardiac arrest, primary respiratory arrest without cardiac arrest, focal stroke, and traumatic brain injury.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Anoxic Brain Injury (ABI):** Diffuse brain injury from global cessation of cerebral blood flow (cardiac arrest) or oxygen delivery (severe hypoxia)
- **Post-Cardiac Arrest Syndrome (PCAS):** Multi-organ dysfunction following ROSC, including anoxic brain injury, myocardial dysfunction, systemic ischemia-reperfusion injury, and persistent precipitating pathology
- **Targeted Temperature Management (TTM):** Controlled cooling to 32-36C for at least 24h to reduce secondary neuronal injury
- **Neuroprognostication:** Multimodal assessment of neurological outcome performed no earlier than 72h after return to normothermia
- **Lance-Adams Syndrome:** Chronic post-hypoxic action myoclonus in cardiac arrest survivors who regain consciousness; distinct from early status myoclonus and compatible with good outcome

---

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

---

**CRITICAL: NEUROPROGNOSTICATION TIMING**

**Do NOT prognosticate before 72 hours after return to normothermia (rewarming).** Earlier assessment is unreliable due to residual effects of sedation, hypothermia, metabolic derangements, and neuromuscular blocking agents. No single test is sufficient for prognostication — a multimodal approach is mandatory (AAN 2023, ERC/ESICM 2021).

## APPENDIX A: NEUROPROGNOSTICATION ALGORITHM

### Multimodal Prognostication Protocol (>=72h After Rewarming)

**Prerequisites before prognostication:**

1. At least 72h have elapsed since return to normothermia
2. All sedation discontinued for at least 5 half-lives (or drug levels measured)
3. Neuromuscular blocking agents discontinued for at least 5 half-lives (confirm with train-of-four)
4. Core temperature 36-37.5C
5. No severe metabolic derangements (glucose, electrolytes, renal/hepatic failure)
6. No residual hypothermia effects

**Step 1: Clinical Examination**

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Absent pupillary light reflex bilaterally at >=72h | POOR prognosis indicator (FPR <5%) |
| Absent corneal reflexes bilaterally at >=72h | POOR prognosis indicator (use with other modalities) |
| Motor response M1 (no motor) or M2 (extension) at >=72h | POOR prognosis indicator (FPR 10-20% if used alone) |
| Status myoclonus within 48h (continuous >30 min) | POOR prognosis indicator (but not 100% — some survivors reported) |
| Any motor response M3 or better at >=72h | May indicate potential for recovery; continue monitoring |

**Step 2: Ancillary Testing (At Least 2 Concordant Findings Required)**

| Test | Poor Outcome Indicator | False Positive Rate |
|------|----------------------|---------------------|
| SSEP: Bilateral N20 absence | Highly predictive of poor outcome | <1% (most reliable single test) |
| EEG: Burst-suppression without reactivity at >=72h | Highly predictive of poor outcome | ~5% |
| EEG: Suppression (<10 uV) at >=72h | Highly predictive of poor outcome | ~2% |
| EEG: Absent reactivity at >=72h | Supportive of poor prognosis | ~10% |
| NSE: >33 ug/L at 48-72h (confirm no hemolysis) | Supportive of poor prognosis | ~10% at 33; <5% at >60 |
| CT: GWR <1.10 at 24-48h | Supportive of poor prognosis | ~5-10% |
| MRI DWI: Extensive cortical/subcortical restriction (day 2-7) | Highly predictive of poor outcome | <5% |

**Step 3: Interpretation**

- **Poor prognosis confirmed:** >=2 concordant poor prognostic indicators from DIFFERENT modalities (e.g., bilateral N20 absent + highly malignant EEG + NSE >60)
- **Indeterminate:** Discordant results or only 1 modality abnormal; continue observation, repeat testing, consider additional modalities
- **Potentially favorable:** Improving clinical exam, present N20 on SSEP, continuous reactive EEG background, normal or mildly elevated NSE

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
- No single test is sufficient to declare poor prognosis
- Always use at least 2 concordant modalities from different categories
- Account for ALL confounders (sedation, temperature, metabolic, NMBAs)
- Self-fulfilling prophecy: premature WLST biases outcome literature — allow adequate time
- Some patients with early myoclonus make meaningful recovery; myoclonus alone is NOT sufficient for poor prognostication

## APPENDIX B: TARGETED TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT (TTM) PROTOCOL

### Initiation Phase (Target: Reach Goal Temperature Within 4 Hours)

| Step | Action | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Select target temperature | 32-36C (based on institutional protocol; TTM2 trial supports 36C with strict fever prevention) |
| 2 | Initiate cooling | Surface: Arctic Sun, cooling blankets. Intravascular: Thermogard XP, CoolGard. Cold saline (4C, 30 mL/kg) NOT recommended as sole cooling method (RINSE trial: no benefit, possible harm) |
| 3 | Insert temperature probe | Esophageal (most accurate) or bladder catheter with temp probe |
| 4 | Start anti-shivering protocol | Meperidine 25-50 mg IV PRN; buspirone 30 mg q8h; Mg infusion; escalate to NMBAs if refractory |
| 5 | Order cEEG | Mandatory; seizures undetectable clinically in sedated/paralyzed patients |
| 6 | Check electrolytes | K, Mg, Ca, Phos q4-6h (hypothermia shifts K intracellularly; hypokalemia risk) |

### Maintenance Phase (24-48 Hours at Target Temperature)

| Parameter | Target | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Temperature | Within 0.5C of target | Adjust cooling device; check probe position |
| Potassium | 4.0-4.5 mEq/L | Aggressive replacement; caution — K will rise during rewarming |
| Shivering (BSAS) | 0 | Stepwise: acetaminophen -> meperidine -> buspirone -> Mg -> dexmedetomidine -> NMBAs |
| Glucose | 140-180 mg/dL | Insulin resistance increases with hypothermia; may need higher doses |
| Bradycardia | HR 40-60 acceptable | Sinus bradycardia expected at 33C; only treat if hemodynamically significant |

### Rewarming Phase (CRITICAL — Controlled and Slow)

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Rewarming rate | 0.25C/hour (NEVER >0.5C/hour); rapid rewarming associated with rebound cerebral edema, ICP elevation, and rebound hyperthermia |
| Duration | 12-16h from 33C to 37C; 4-8h from 36C to 37C |
| Potassium | Reduce replacement during rewarming; K rises as it shifts extracellularly; risk of HYPERKALEMIA |
| Post-rewarming | Maintain normothermia (<37.7C) for at least 72h post-ROSC using acetaminophen and cooling devices |

## APPENDIX C: MYOCLONUS CLASSIFICATION IN ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY

| Type | Timing | Features | Prognosis |
|------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Early status myoclonus | Within 24-72h post-arrest | Generalized, continuous or near-continuous myoclonic jerking; often involves face, limbs, axial muscles; typically in deeply comatose patients; may be stimulus-sensitive | Generally associated with POOR outcome; however, NOT invariably fatal — some survivors with good recovery reported (especially if other prognostic indicators are favorable) |
| Acute cortical myoclonus | Within 72h | Focal or multifocal; stimulus-sensitive; cortical origin on EEG (time-locked cortical discharges) | Variable; may respond to ASMs; use multimodal prognostication |
| Lance-Adams syndrome | Days to weeks after arrest (during recovery) | Action myoclonus in CONSCIOUS patients; triggered by voluntary movements; intention myoclonus; may be severely disabling but patient is AWAKE | GOOD prognosis for survival (patient is conscious); may improve with clonazepam, valproic acid, levetiracetam; long-term disability varies |
| Subcortical/reticular myoclonus | Variable | Generalized; no cortical correlate on EEG; brainstem origin | Variable |

**KEY PRINCIPLE:** Myoclonus alone is NEVER sufficient for prognostication. Always integrate with multimodal assessment. The distinction between status myoclonus (continuous, generalized, in comatose patient) vs Lance-Adams (action myoclonus in awake patient) has critical prognostic implications.

## CHANGE LOG

**v1.2 (February 12, 2026)**
- Converted Section 3D treatment table from non-standard 11-column format to standard 10-column format per style guide
- Merged Pre-Treatment Requirements column into Contraindications column with "Pre-treatment:" prefix to preserve clinical data
- All treatment tables (3A, 3B, 3C, 3D) now use consistent 10-column layout: Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU

**v1.1 (January 30, 2026)**
- Fixed column order in all lab tables (1A, 1B, 1C) to place venue columns (ED/HOSP/OPD/ICU) as last 4 columns per style guide
- Fixed column order in all imaging tables (2A, 2B, 2C) to place venue columns as last 4 columns per style guide
- Fixed column order in Section 6 Monitoring to place venue columns as last 4 columns per style guide
- Standardized structured dosing format (dose :: route :: frequency :: instructions) across all treatment tables (3A, 3B, 3C, 3D)
- Added OPD coverage for follow-up labs (CBC, CMP, glucose, Mg, Ca, Phos) in Section 1A for survivor clinic visits
- Added ICU column to Sections 4B and 4C for setting consistency
- Updated section dividers to Unicode box-drawing characters
- Added Pre-Treatment Requirements to Section 3D medications (amantadine, sertraline, methylphenidate, modafinil, baclofen, tizanidine, botox)
- Cleaned up treatment names to remove redundant section headers (e.g., "Shivering management:" prefix removed)
- Fixed pneumatic compression devices Route column (was "-", now "External")
- Added REVISED date to header metadata
- Updated version to 1.1

**v1.0 (January 30, 2026)**
- Initial template creation
- Comprehensive post-cardiac arrest care bundle including TTM protocol
- Multimodal neuroprognostication algorithm (clinical exam, EEG, SSEP, MRI, NSE, CT GWR)
- Confounder identification and elimination checklist
- Myoclonus classification (early status myoclonus vs Lance-Adams syndrome)
- Rehabilitation pathway for survivors (amantadine, spasticity management, cognitive rehab)
- Seizure management protocol including refractory status epilepticus
- Family communication and goals of care guidance
- Organ donation considerations
- All citations include PubMed links where available
