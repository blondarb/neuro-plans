**STATUS:** Revised per physician feedback

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** New Onset Seizure

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Syncope (convulsive syncope) | Brief (<15 sec), triggered by standing/Valsalva/micturition, rapid recovery, no post-ictal confusion, possible prodrome (lightheaded, tunnel vision) | ECG, orthostatic vitals, tilt table test, echocardiogram |
| Psychogenic non-epileptic spells (PNES) | Variable/atypical semiology, prolonged duration, preserved awareness with bilateral movements, eye closure, pelvic thrusting, no post-ictal confusion, psychiatric comorbidity | Video-EEG capturing event; normal prolactin |
| Transient ischemic attack (TIA) | Negative symptoms (weakness, numbness), no LOC, no convulsive activity | MRI DWI, vascular imaging |
| Migraine with aura | Gradual onset, spreading symptoms, headache follows, stereotyped | Clinical history, normal EEG |
| Hypoglycemia | Diaphoresis, tremor, confusion, rapid glucose corrects symptoms | Fingerstick glucose |
| Cardiac arrhythmia | Palpitations, sudden LOC without warning, rapid recovery | ECG, Holter monitor, event recorder, EP study |
| Transient global amnesia | Isolated anterograde amnesia, repetitive questioning, no convulsive activity | Clinical presentation (self-limited), MRI DWI (hippocampal) |
| Sleep disorders (parasomnias, cataplexy) | Occur from sleep, specific features (cataplexy with emotion) | Sleep study, clinical history |
| Movement disorders (dystonia, tics) | Stereotyped, no LOC, suppressible (tics), may have sensory urge | Clinical history, video |
| Drug intoxication/withdrawal | History of substance use, known withdrawal timeline | Toxicology screen, history |
| Metabolic encephalopathy | Gradual onset, diffuse abnormality, asterixis, no discrete seizures | Labs (ammonia, glucose, Na), EEG (diffuse slowing) |

## 6. MONITORING PARAMETERS

| Parameter | Frequency | Target/Threshold | Action if Abnormal |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Neurologic exam (level of consciousness, focal deficits) | Q1-2h in ED; Q4h inpatient; each visit OPD | Return to baseline | If prolonged post-ictal state: continuous EEG to rule out non-convulsive status |
| Vital signs | Continuous in ED/ICU; Q4h floor | Stable | Treat hyperthermia, hypotension, hypoxia |
| Glucose | On arrival; repeat if altered | >70 mg/dL | Dextrose if low |
| Electrolytes (Na, Ca, Mg) | On arrival; daily if abnormal | Normal ranges | Correct deficiencies; identify cause |
| ASM level (phenytoin, valproate, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) | Trough level 5-7 days after initiation or dose change; PRN | Therapeutic range (drug-specific) | Adjust dose; check free level for phenytoin |

**ASM Therapeutic Level Reference:**
| ASM | Therapeutic Range | Notes |
|-----|-------------------|-------|
| Phenytoin (total) | 10-20 Î¼g/mL | Check FREE level (1-2 Î¼g/mL) if hypoalbuminemia, renal failure, or pregnancy |
| Valproate | 50-100 Î¼g/mL | Higher levels may be needed; monitor for toxicity |
| Carbamazepine | 4-12 Î¼g/mL | Autoinduction occurs over 2-4 weeks |
| Phenobarbital | 15-40 Î¼g/mL | Sedation common at higher levels |
| Lacosamide | 10-20 Î¼g/mL | Level monitoring not routinely required |
| Levetiracetam | 12-46 Î¼g/mL | Level monitoring not routinely required; clinical response guides dosing |
| LFTs | Baseline; q3-6 months on valproate, carbamazepine | Normal | Discontinue if hepatotoxicity; hold if transaminases >3Ã— ULN |
| CBC | Baseline; q3-6 months on carbamazepine, valproate | Normal | Discontinue if significant bone marrow suppression |
| Sodium | Baseline; periodically on oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine | >130 mEq/L | Reduce dose or switch if severe hyponatremia |
| EEG | Within 24-48h of first seizure; repeat if diagnosis unclear | No ongoing seizures | Adjust treatment if epileptiform activity or non-convulsive seizures |
| MRI brain | Within 2 weeks of first seizure; sooner if structural cause suspected | No new lesions | Address structural cause; refer to appropriate specialist |

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Disposition | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| **Discharge home** | Single, self-limited seizure; returned to baseline; no dangerous etiology identified on initial workup; reliable adult supervision for 24h; ASM initiated or deferred with close follow-up; outpatient EEG and MRI arranged; understands return precautions and driving restriction |
| **Admit to floor (observation)** | Prolonged post-ictal period; multiple seizures; new structural lesion requiring monitoring; ASM loading requiring observation; social situation preventing safe discharge; need for inpatient EEG; new focal neurologic deficit |
| **Admit to ICU** | Status epilepticus (current or recent); recurrent seizures despite treatment; need for continuous EEG monitoring; airway compromise; hemodynamic instability; significant aspiration; large structural lesion with mass effect; CNS infection |
| **Transfer to higher level** | MRI unavailable; EEG unavailable; neurology not available for consultation; need for neurosurgical intervention unavailable at facility |
