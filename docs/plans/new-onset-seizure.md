# New Onset Seizure

**VERSION:** 1.2
**CREATED:** January 13, 2026
**REVISED:** January 20, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** New Onset Seizure

**ICD-10:** R56.9 (Unspecified convulsions), G40.909 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus)

**SCOPE:** Initial evaluation and management of first-time unprovoked seizure or first presentation of seizure activity in adults. Covers immediate stabilization, diagnostic workup to identify etiology, acute treatment, and framework for anti-seizure medication (ASM) initiation. Excludes status epilepticus (see "Status Epilepticus" template), pediatric seizures, febrile seizures, and known epilepsy with breakthrough seizures.

## 2. DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING & STUDIES

### 2A. Essential/First-line

| Report side effects (mood changes, rash, dizziness, cognitive issues) promptly; do NOT stop medication without calling | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Avoid flashing/strobe lights if photosensitive seizures suspected | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

*Note: ICU patients typically receive these recommendations at step-down or discharge.*

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Sleep hygiene: aim for 7-9 hours nightly; maintain regular sleep schedule | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Avoid alcohol (lowers seizure threshold; interacts with ASMs) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Avoid illicit drugs (especially stimulants: cocaine, amphetamines) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Stress management techniques | — | — | ✓ | — |
| Regular moderate exercise (not extreme sleep deprivation from overtraining) | — | — | ✓ | — |
| Medication adherence: use pill organizers, phone alarms, refill reminders | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Folic acid supplementation 1-4 mg daily for women of childbearing potential (especially if on enzyme-inducing ASMs) | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Bone health: vitamin D 1000-2000 IU daily; calcium as needed (enzyme-inducing ASMs affect bone density) | — | — | ✓ | — |
| Avoid known personal triggers (flashing lights, certain foods, stress, if identified) | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Home safety modifications: pad sharp furniture corners, avoid glass shower doors, use microwave instead of stovetop when alone | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Seizure alert devices or apps for those living alone (optional) | — | — | ✓ | — |
| Smoking cessation (increases ASM metabolism; general health) | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Transient global amnesia | Isolated anterograde amnesia, repetitive questioning, no convulsive activity | Clinical presentation (self-limited), MRI DWI (hippocampal) |
| Sleep disorders (parasomnias, cataplexy) | Occur from sleep, specific features (cataplexy with emotion) | Sleep study, clinical history |
| Movement disorders (dystonia, tics) | Stereotyped, no LOC, suppressible (tics), may have sensory urge | Clinical history, video |
| Drug intoxication/withdrawal | History of substance use, known withdrawal timeline | Toxicology screen, history |

| ASM level (phenytoin, valproate, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) | Trough level 5-7 days after initiation or dose change; PRN | Therapeutic range (drug-specific) | Adjust dose; check free level for phenytoin | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| LFTs | Baseline; q3-6 months on valproate, carbamazepine | Normal | Discontinue if hepatotoxicity; hold if transaminases >3× ULN | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

| Sodium | Baseline; periodically on oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine | >130 mEq/L | Reduce dose or switch if severe hyponatremia | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| EEG | Within 24-48h of first seizure; repeat if diagnosis unclear | No ongoing seizures | Adjust treatment if epileptiform activity or non-convulsive seizures | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| MRI brain | Within 2 weeks of first seizure; sooner if structural cause suspected | No new lesions | Address structural cause; refer to appropriate specialist | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |

**ASM Therapeutic Level Reference:**

| ASM | Therapeutic Range | Notes |

| Carbamazepine | 4-12 μg/mL | Autoinduction occurs over 2-4 weeks |
| Phenobarbital | 15-40 μg/mL | Sedation common at higher levels |
| Lacosamide | 10-20 μg/mL | Level monitoring not routinely required |
| Levetiracetam | 12-46 μg/mL | Level monitoring not routinely required; clinical response guides dosing |
