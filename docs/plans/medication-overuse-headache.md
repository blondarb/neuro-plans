# Medication Overuse Headache

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 29, 2026
**REVISED:** January 29, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Medication Overuse Headache (MOH)

**ICD-10:** G44.40 (Drug-induced headache, not elsewhere classified, not intractable), G44.41 (Drug-induced headache, not elsewhere classified, intractable)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC), 80053 (CMP), 84443 (TSH), 80076 (LFTs), 82565 (BUN/Creatinine), 85652 (ESR), 80307 (Urine drug screen), 70551 (MRI brain without contrast), 70552 (MRI brain with contrast), 96365 (IV DHE protocol), 96374 (IV ketorolac), J0585 (OnabotulinumtoxinA)

**SYNONYMS:** Medication overuse headache, MOH, rebound headache, analgesic overuse headache, drug-induced headache, medication-induced headache, chronic daily headache from medication overuse, transformed migraine, analgesic rebound headache, triptan overuse headache, opioid overuse headache, ergotamine overuse headache, butalbital overuse headache, painkiller headache, medication misuse headache, CDH, chronic daily headache

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis and management of medication overuse headache in adults. Covers identification of offending medications, withdrawal strategies, preventive medication initiation, and relapse prevention. Excludes primary headache disorders without overuse component, and headache due to medication side effects (not overuse).

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Medication Overuse Headache (MOH):** Headache occurring ≥15 days/month in a patient with pre-existing headache who regularly overuses acute headache medications for >3 months
- **Medication Overuse:** Use of acute headache medications on ≥10-15 days/month depending on drug class
- **Chronic Daily Headache:** Headache occurring ≥15 days/month for >3 months

---

**DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (ICHD-3):**

**A.** Headache occurring on ≥15 days per month in a patient with a pre-existing headache disorder
**B.** Regular overuse for >3 months of one or more drugs that can be taken for acute and/or symptomatic treatment of headache:
  - Simple analgesics ≥15 days/month
  - Triptans, ergots, opioids, or combination analgesics ≥10 days/month
  - Any combination of above ≥10 days/month
**C.** Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis

**Drug-Specific Subtypes:**
- **Ergotamine-overuse headache**
- **Triptan-overuse headache**
- **Simple analgesic-overuse headache** (acetaminophen, NSAIDs)
- **Opioid-overuse headache**
- **Combination analgesic-overuse headache** (e.g., butalbital-containing)

|-----------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Headache frequency (days/month) | - | Daily | Each visit | - | Monthly | <15 days/month | Adjust preventive |
| Medication use (days/month) | - | Daily | Each visit | - | Monthly | Triptans <10, NSAIDs <15, total <10 | Counsel; adjust strategy |
| MIDAS or HIT-6 score | - | - | ROUTINE | - | q3 months | Improving disability | Adjust treatment |
| Headache diary review | - | ROUTINE | Each visit | - | Ongoing | Documented compliance | Reinforce education |
| Preventive medication adherence | - | - | Each visit | - | Each visit | Taking as prescribed | Address barriers |
| Depression/anxiety screening | - | ROUTINE | Each visit | - | q3-6 months | Negative or stable | Refer if positive |
| Weight (if on topiramate/valproate) | - | - | Each visit | - | Each visit | Stable | Adjust medication |

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Disposition | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Outpatient management | Most patients; mild-moderate disability, no significant opioid/barbiturate dependence |
| Admit to hospital | Failed outpatient withdrawal, severe disability, significant opioid/barbiturate dependence, psychiatric comorbidity requiring stabilization, need for IV protocol |
| Discharge from hospital | Withdrawal completed, preventive started, headache improving, follow-up arranged |
| Headache specialist follow-up | Within 2-4 weeks of withdrawal; then q1-3 months |
| Relapse management | May need repeat withdrawal; intensify preventive; consider CGRP mAbs |

## 8. EVIDENCE & REFERENCES

| Recommendation | Evidence Level | Source |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria for MOH | Class I | International Headache Society 2018 |
| Abrupt withdrawal effective for simple analgesics/triptans | Class II, Level B | Multiple studies |
| Bridge therapy with corticosteroids | Class II, Level B | Multiple studies |
| Preventive medication should be started with withdrawal | Class I, Level A | Expert consensus; multiple guidelines |
| Topiramate effective for migraine prevention | Class I, Level A | Multiple RCTs |
| CGRP mAbs may have lower MOH risk | Class II, Level B | Emerging evidence |
| Gepants may have lower MOH risk | Class II, Level C | Emerging evidence |
| ~40% relapse rate at 1 year | Class II | Observational studies |
| Opioids and barbiturates have highest MOH risk | Class II, Level B | Multiple studies |

## NOTES

- MOH is one of the most common causes of chronic daily headache
- Paradoxically, the medications that help acute headaches CAUSE chronic headaches when overused
- Triptans, opioids, and barbiturates have LOWER threshold for MOH (≥10 days/month)
- Butalbital-containing medications (Fioricet, Fiorinal) are particularly problematic and should be avoided
- Opioids should almost NEVER be used for primary headache disorders
- Patient education is critical - they must understand the paradox of MOH
- Expect worsening during withdrawal ("detox headache") before improvement
- Preventive medication should be started during or immediately after withdrawal
- CGRP antagonists (gepants, mAbs) may have lower MOH potential - useful in MOH-prone patients
- Relapse is common (~40%) - ongoing monitoring and reinforcement needed
- Behavioral approaches (CBT, biofeedback) are important adjuncts

## CHANGE LOG

**v1.0 (January 29, 2026)**
- Initial template creation
- ICHD-3 criteria for MOH
- Outpatient and inpatient withdrawal protocols
- Bridge therapy options
- Emphasis on medication limits and patient education
