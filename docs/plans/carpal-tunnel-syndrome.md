- Sensitivity: 50-60%; Specificity: 67-77%

**Carpal Compression Test (Durkan's Test)**
- Technique: Apply direct pressure over carpal tunnel for 30 seconds
- Positive: Reproduction of paresthesias
- Sensitivity: 64-87%; Specificity: 83-90%
- May be more sensitive than Tinel sign

**Flick Sign**
- Technique: Ask patient what they do when symptoms occur at night
- Positive: Patient demonstrates shaking/flicking hands for relief
- Sensitivity: 93%; Specificity: 96%
- Highly suggestive of CTS when present

**Hand Elevation Test**
- Technique: Raise hands above head for 1-2 minutes
- Positive: Reproduction of numbness/paresthesias
- Sensitivity: 75-89%; Specificity: 87-98%

### Severity Assessment

**Clinical Severity Grading**
- **Mild:** Intermittent paresthesias, nocturnal symptoms only, normal exam
- **Moderate:** Frequent paresthesias, daytime symptoms, mild sensory loss, no weakness
- **Severe:** Constant numbness, thenar weakness/atrophy, impaired two-point discrimination

**Electrodiagnostic Severity (AANEM Classification)**
- **Mild:** Prolonged sensory latency only; normal motor studies
- **Moderate:** Prolonged sensory and motor distal latencies; reduced SNAP amplitude
- **Severe:** Absent sensory response; prolonged motor latency with reduced CMAP; fibrillations/positive sharp waves in APB

## APPENDIX B: Nerve Conduction Study Criteria for CTS

### Standard Electrodiagnostic Criteria

**Sensory Studies**
- Median sensory distal latency >3.5 ms (14 cm distance) OR
- Median-ulnar sensory latency difference >0.5 ms OR
- Median-radial sensory latency difference >0.5 ms

**Motor Studies**
- Median motor distal latency >4.2 ms

**Combined Sensory Index (CSI) - Robinson Criteria**
- Sum of: (median-ulnar palm latency difference) + (median-ulnar digit 4 difference) + (median-radial thumb difference)
- CSI >0.9 ms is abnormal

### Electrodiagnostic Severity Classification

| Severity | Sensory | Motor | EMG |
|----------|---------|-------|-----|
| Minimal | Abnormal comparative studies only (palm or digit) | Normal | Normal |
| Mild | Prolonged absolute sensory latency | Normal | Normal |
| Moderate | Prolonged sensory latency; reduced SNAP amplitude | Prolonged motor latency | Normal |
| Severe | Absent sensory response | Prolonged motor latency; reduced CMAP | Fibrillations/PSWs in APB |
| Very Severe | Absent sensory response | Absent or very low CMAP | Chronic denervation in APB |
