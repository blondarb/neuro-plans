# REM Sleep Behavior Disorder

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** February 7, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** REM Sleep Behavior Disorder

**ICD-10:** G47.52 (REM sleep behavior disorder)

**CPT CODES:** 95810 (Polysomnography (PSG) with expanded EMG montage), 95803 (Actigraphy), 70553 (MRI brain with and without contrast), 78607 (DaT scan - dopamine transporter imaging), 85025 (CBC), 80053 (CMP), 84443 (TSH), 82607 (Vitamin B12), 82728 (Serum ferritin), 83540 (Serum iron), 83550 (TIBC), 80307 (Urine drug screen), 86235 (ANA), 86140 (CRP), 86200 (ESR), 86592 (RPR), 86703 (HIV), 78452 (Cardiac MIBG scintigraphy)

**SYNONYMS:** RBD, REM behavior disorder, REM parasomnia, dream enactment behavior, violent sleep behavior, REM sleep without atonia, isolated RBD, iRBD, idiopathic RBD, prodromal synucleinopathy, parasomnia overlap disorder

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis and management of REM sleep behavior disorder in adults. Covers idiopathic/isolated RBD and symptomatic RBD associated with synucleinopathies. Includes diagnostic workup, safety interventions, pharmacologic treatment, and longitudinal monitoring for phenoconversion to Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. Excludes other parasomnias as separate entities, though differential diagnosis is addressed.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD):** A parasomnia characterized by loss of normal skeletal muscle atonia during REM sleep, resulting in dream enactment behaviors ranging from vocalizations to complex, often violent motor activity
- **REM Without Atonia (RSWA):** Sustained or intermittent elevation of tonic or phasic EMG activity during REM sleep; the electrophysiologic hallmark of RBD documented on video-PSG
- **Isolated/Idiopathic RBD (iRBD):** RBD occurring without an identified underlying neurological disorder at the time of diagnosis; the majority will eventually phenoconvert to a synucleinopathy
- **Phenoconversion:** The emergence of a defined neurodegenerative disorder (Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy) in a patient previously diagnosed with isolated RBD
- **Synucleinopathy:** Group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by abnormal aggregation of alpha-synuclein protein, including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy
- **Dream Enactment Behavior (DEB):** Motor activity during REM sleep that corresponds to dream content; may include punching, kicking, screaming, falling out of bed, or injuring a bed partner
- **Alpha-Synuclein Seed Amplification Assay (SAA):** CSF-based assay that detects misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates; emerging biomarker for prodromal synucleinopathy in iRBD patients

---

**DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (ICSD-3-TR):**

**REM Sleep Behavior Disorder - All of the following:**

1. Repeated episodes of sleep-related vocalization and/or complex motor behaviors
2. These behaviors are documented by video-polysomnography to occur during REM sleep or, based on the clinical history of dream enactment, are presumed to occur during REM sleep
3. Video-polysomnography demonstrates REM sleep without atonia (RSWA)
4. The disturbance is not better explained by another sleep disorder, mental disorder, medication, or substance use

**Key Clinical Features:**

1. Dream enactment behavior: punching, kicking, leaping, running, screaming during sleep (100%)
2. REM without atonia on PSG (required for definitive diagnosis)
3. Bed partner injury (up to 60%)
4. Self-injury from falling out of bed (up to 30%)
5. Dream recall often involving being chased or attacked (vivid, action-filled dreams)

**Phenoconversion Risk (Isolated RBD):**
- 5-year risk: ~33%
- 10-year risk: ~75%
- 14-year risk: ~91%
- Most common phenoconversion: Parkinson's disease (~50%), dementia with Lewy bodies (~25%), multiple system atrophy (~5%)

## 4. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS

### 4A. Referrals & Consults

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Sleep medicine specialist for video-PSG with expanded EMG montage, diagnosis confirmation, and pharmacotherapy optimization (gold standard diagnosis requires in-lab PSG) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Neurology/movement disorder specialist for longitudinal phenoconversion monitoring; annual assessment for emerging parkinsonism, cognitive decline, or autonomic dysfunction is essential given >90% lifetime conversion risk | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Neuropsychology for baseline cognitive testing (MoCA and detailed neuropsychological battery) and serial monitoring if cognitive concerns emerge; cognitive decline may herald phenoconversion to DLB | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Psychiatry if discontinuation of RBD-triggering antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs) is being considered; ensure safe transition to non-RBD-triggering alternatives (bupropion, trazodone) without psychiatric decompensation | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Physical/occupational therapy for fall risk assessment and home safety evaluation; particularly important if early motor features of parkinsonism emerge | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Otolaryngology or pulmonology if concurrent obstructive sleep apnea identified on PSG, as untreated OSA can exacerbate RBD and clonazepam is contraindicated in severe OSA | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4B. Patient/Family Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| RBD is a sleep disorder where normal muscle paralysis during dreaming sleep is absent, causing you to physically act out dreams; this is a neurological condition, not a behavioral or psychological problem | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Bedroom safety is the most important intervention: lower bed to floor, remove sharp/dangerous objects, pad furniture, lock windows, and consider separate sleeping if violent behaviors put a bed partner at risk | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Do not attempt to restrain or wake someone during an RBD episode as this may worsen agitation; instead, move to a safe distance and ensure the environment is clear of hazards | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Take melatonin or clonazepam exactly as prescribed 30-60 minutes before bedtime; do not abruptly stop clonazepam as this may cause withdrawal symptoms and rebound RBD | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid alcohol and caffeine in the evening as these can worsen RBD symptoms and disrupt sleep architecture | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Report any new symptoms to your neurologist immediately: tremor, slowness of movement, balance problems, memory changes, constipation, loss of smell, or lightheadedness upon standing (these may signal conversion to a related neurological condition) | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Inform all healthcare providers about RBD diagnosis; certain medications (SSRIs, SNRIs, beta-blockers, tramadol) can trigger or worsen RBD and should be avoided when alternatives exist | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Keep a sleep diary documenting frequency and severity of dream enactment episodes, injuries, and medication effects to guide treatment adjustments | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Maintain regular sleep-wake schedule with consistent bedtime and wake time to promote consolidated sleep and reduce RBD episode frequency | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Regular moderate exercise (30 minutes daily) to improve sleep quality and potentially slow neurodegenerative progression; avoid vigorous exercise within 3 hours of bedtime | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs; alcohol disrupts REM sleep architecture and may exacerbate dream enactment behaviors | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Limit caffeine intake, especially after noon, as caffeine disrupts sleep continuity and may increase nocturnal arousals | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid known RBD-triggering medications whenever possible: SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram), SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine), beta-blockers, and tramadol; discuss alternatives with prescribing physicians | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Stress reduction and relaxation techniques before bedtime (meditation, deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation) may reduce episode frequency | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Maintain healthy body weight and manage cardiovascular risk factors; metabolic health may influence neurodegenerative risk | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Engage in cognitively stimulating activities (reading, puzzles, social interaction) to promote cognitive reserve | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

| Sleep medicine referral | All patients with suspected RBD for video-PSG diagnosis and treatment management |
| Neurology/movement disorder referral | All patients with confirmed iRBD for longitudinal phenoconversion surveillance; urgent if new motor, cognitive, or autonomic symptoms emerge |
| Follow-up frequency | Every 2-4 weeks during initial treatment titration; every 6 months once stable; annually for comprehensive phenoconversion screening (cognitive, motor, olfactory, autonomic) |

## NOTES

- RBD is the strongest known prodromal marker for alpha-synucleinopathies; over 90% of patients with isolated RBD will eventually develop PD, DLB, or MSA over their lifetime
- Video-PSG with expanded EMG montage (including bilateral FDS, anterior tibialis, and extensor digitorum brevis) is required for definitive diagnosis; clinical history alone is insufficient
- REM without atonia (RSWA) is the electrophysiologic hallmark; quantified using the SINBAR scoring method with tonic and phasic EMG activity cutoffs
- Melatonin is preferred first-line pharmacotherapy due to its excellent safety profile, especially in elderly patients, those with OSA, and those with cognitive impairment where clonazepam carries significant risk
- Clonazepam is highly effective (80-90%) but must be used cautiously in elderly patients, those with OSA (may worsen respiratory events), cognitive impairment (may worsen), and fall risk
- SSRIs, SNRIs, beta-blockers, and tramadol are well-established triggers of RBD; medication review and substitution should be performed in all newly diagnosed patients
- Annual phenoconversion screening should include cognitive testing (MoCA), motor examination (UPDRS-III), olfactory testing (UPSIT), and autonomic assessment (orthostatic BP, constipation, urinary symptoms)
- DaT scan should be considered when new motor symptoms emerge or when risk stratification is desired; reduced striatal uptake indicates prodromal nigrostriatal degeneration
- Alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay (SAA) in CSF is an emerging high-sensitivity biomarker for underlying synuclein pathology but is not yet widely available in clinical practice
- Anti-IgLON5 disease is a recently recognized autoimmune condition that can present with RBD and other parasomnia features; paraneoplastic antibody testing should be considered in atypical presentations
- RBD onset typically occurs in the 6th-7th decade; male predominance (approximately 80-90% male); earlier onset or female sex should prompt consideration of secondary causes
- Bed partner injury occurs in up to 60% of cases; separate sleeping arrangements may be necessary until pharmacotherapy achieves adequate control
- There is currently no proven disease-modifying therapy to prevent or delay phenoconversion; clinical trials are ongoing for potential neuroprotective interventions in iRBD
- Pregnancy management: melatonin safety data limited in pregnancy; clonazepam is FDA category D; consult maternal-fetal medicine
