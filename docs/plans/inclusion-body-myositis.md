## APPENDIX A: IBM DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (ENMC 2011)

**European Neuromuscular Centre (ENMC) 2011 Classification Criteria for IBM:**

### Clinico-Pathologically Defined IBM
ALL of the following:
1. Duration of weakness >12 months
2. Age at onset >45 years
3. CK no more than 15x ULN
4. Muscle biopsy showing:
   - Endomysial inflammatory infiltrate
   - Rimmed vacuoles
   - Protein accumulation (p62, TDP-43) OR 15-18nm tubulofilaments on EM

### Clinically Defined IBM
ALL of the following:
1. Duration of weakness >12 months
2. Age at onset >45 years
3. CK no more than 15x ULN
4. Finger flexor weakness > shoulder abductor weakness AND knee extensor weakness > hip flexor weakness
5. Muscle biopsy showing endomysial inflammatory infiltrate invading non-necrotic muscle fibers OR upregulation of MHC-I, BUT NO rimmed vacuoles or protein accumulations

### Probable IBM
ALL of the following:
1. Duration of weakness >12 months
2. Age at onset >45 years
3. CK no more than 15x ULN
4. Finger flexor weakness > shoulder abductor weakness AND/OR knee extensor weakness > hip flexor weakness
5. No biopsy performed

**Clinical Pearl:** The characteristic pattern of weakness in IBM is **asymmetric** involvement of:
- **Finger flexors** (FDP weakness: inability to make a tight fist, weak grip)
- **Quadriceps** (knee extensors: difficulty rising from chairs, climbing stairs, falls)
- **Wrist flexors** and **ankle dorsiflexors** (foot drop in later disease)
- **Neck flexors** (head drop in advanced cases)

**Key distinguishing feature from PM:** Distal finger flexor and quadriceps weakness with relative sparing of deltoids is pathognomonic for IBM. PM presents with symmetric proximal weakness (deltoids, hip flexors) WITHOUT distal finger flexor involvement.

## APPENDIX B: IBM NATURAL HISTORY AND PROGNOSIS

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Age of onset** | Typically >50 years (mean 60-65); rarely before age 45 |
| **Sex distribution** | Male predominance (3:1 male to female) |
| **Rate of progression** | Slow, insidious; over years to decades |
| **Time to cane/walker** | 5-10 years from symptom onset (variable) |
| **Time to wheelchair** | 10-15 years from symptom onset (variable) |
| **Dysphagia** | 40-80% develop dysphagia; may be presenting symptom |
| **Respiratory** | Late involvement; respiratory failure uncommon but possible in advanced disease |
| **Mortality** | Not directly fatal; complications (aspiration pneumonia, falls) contribute to morbidity/mortality |
| **Response to immunotherapy** | Poor; hallmark of IBM; failure to respond to steroids/immunosuppressants should raise suspicion for IBM over PM |
| **Quality of life** | Progressive disability; maintained cognition; adjustment and support important |

**Commonly misdiagnosed as:**
1. Polymyositis (most common misdiagnosis; treated with steroids without improvement)
2. Motor neuron disease/ALS (due to mixed EMG pattern and distal weakness)
3. Peripheral neuropathy (due to distal finger weakness and foot drop)
4. CIDP (due to mixed EMG and weakness pattern)

**Average diagnostic delay:** 5-8 years from symptom onset to correct diagnosis
