### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Tics are involuntary; do not ask the patient to suppress tics or punish tic behaviors as this worsens anxiety and tics | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Tics naturally wax and wane; periods of increased tics do not necessarily mean treatment failure | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Many patients experience improvement in late adolescence/early adulthood; approximately one-third have significant tic reduction by adulthood | - | - | ROUTINE |
| CBIT is the first-line treatment and should be tried before or alongside medications; it teaches skills to manage tics | - | - | ROUTINE |
| Report new involuntary movements, stiffness, or tremor that could indicate medication side effects (EPS/parkinsonism) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Report mood changes, depression, or suicidal thoughts especially if on VMAT2 inhibitors or antipsychotics | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Return to ED if sudden severe tic exacerbation with self-injurious behavior, breathing difficulty from vocal tics, or inability to eat/drink | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Stimulant medications for ADHD are safe with tics and do not need to be discontinued; discuss with your neurologist before stopping | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Keep a tic diary noting triggers (stress, fatigue, excitement), premonitory urges, and response to treatment | - | - | ROUTINE |
| Educate teachers, coaches, and family members about tic disorders to reduce stigma and promote supportive environments | - | - | ROUTINE |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Stress management techniques (mindfulness, deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation) as stress is the most common tic exacerbator | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Adequate sleep (age-appropriate: 8-10 hours for adolescents, 7-9 for adults) as fatigue worsens tics | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Regular aerobic exercise (30+ minutes most days) to reduce tic severity and improve comorbid ADHD/anxiety | - | - | ROUTINE |
| Limit caffeine and energy drinks which exacerbate tics, anxiety, and insomnia | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Activities requiring focused attention (music, sports, art) reduce tics through directed concentration | - | - | ROUTINE |
| Peer support groups (Tourette Association of America, local support groups) for patients and families | - | - | ROUTINE |
| Anti-bullying strategies and school education programs; tic disorders are covered under Section 504 and IDEA | - | - | ROUTINE |
| Identify and avoid triggers where possible (certain situations, foods, sleep deprivation) | - | - | ROUTINE |
| Moderate screen time; excessive screen time exacerbates tics in some patients | - | - | ROUTINE |

| 10 | Minimal impairment |
| 20 | Mild impairment |
| 30 | Moderate impairment |
| 40 | Marked impairment |
| 50 | Severe impairment |

### Total YGTSS Score Interpretation

| Component | Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Total Tic Score | 0-50 | Motor total + Vocal total |
| Impairment Score | 0-50 | Single global impairment rating |
| Global Severity Score | 0-100 | Total Tic Score + Impairment Score |

| Severity | Total Tic Score | Clinical Interpretation |

| Mild | 10-19 | Noticeable but not disruptive |
| Moderate | 20-29 | Clearly present; some functional impact |
| Marked | 30-39 | Prominent tics; significant impairment |
| Severe | 40-50 | Near-constant severe tics; major disability |

## APPENDIX B: TOURETTE SYNDROME DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (DSM-5)

### Tourette Syndrome (F95.2)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| A | Both multiple motor tics AND one or more vocal (phonic) tics have been present at some time during illness, although not necessarily concurrently |
| B | Tics may wax and wane in frequency but have persisted for more than 1 year since first tic onset |
| C | Onset is before age 18 years |
| D | The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition |

### Persistent (Chronic) Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder (F95.1)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| A | Single or multiple motor tics OR vocal tics have been present during the illness, but not both motor and vocal |
| B | Tics have persisted for more than 1 year since first tic onset |
| C | Onset is before age 18 years |
| D | Not attributable to substance or medical condition |
| E | Criteria for Tourette syndrome have never been met |

### Provisional Tic Disorder (F95.0)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| A | Single or multiple motor and/or vocal tics |

| C | Onset is before age 18 years |
| D | Not attributable to substance or medical condition |
| E | Criteria for Tourette syndrome or persistent tic disorder have never been met |

## APPENDIX C: COMMON COMORBIDITIES AND PREVALENCE

| Comorbidity | Prevalence in Tourette | Clinical Notes |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------|
| ADHD | 50-60% | Most common comorbidity; treat with stimulants or alpha-2 agonists (guanfacine preferred for dual benefit); stimulants do NOT worsen tics per AAN guideline |
| OCD | 30-50% | Second most common; often "just right" phenomena rather than contamination fears; SSRIs + CBT with ERP; avoid clomipramine with pimozide |
| Anxiety disorders (GAD, social anxiety) | 30-40% | Worsens tics through stress; CBT; SSRIs; guanfacine helps both tics and anxiety |
| Depression | 20-25% | Screen regularly especially on VMAT2 inhibitors/antipsychotics; SSRIs; CBT; often reactive to chronic tic burden |
| Rage attacks / explosive outbursts | 25-70% | Often most disabling feature; often more impairing than tics; behavioral strategies; mood stabilizers in severe cases |
| Learning disabilities | 20-30% | Neuropsychological testing; IEP/504 plan; educational accommodations |
| Sleep disorders | 25-50% | Insomnia, restless legs, sleep-disordered breathing; sleep hygiene; clonidine helps both tics and insomnia |
| Self-injurious behavior | 14-33% | Head banging, hitting self, eye poking; requires hospitalization if severe; urgent medication optimization |
| Autism spectrum disorder | 5-10% | Distinguished from stereotypies by premonitory urge, waxing/waning pattern, suppressibility |
