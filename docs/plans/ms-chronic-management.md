**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS):** Most common form (~85%); discrete attacks with full or partial recovery
- **Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS):** Progressive accumulation of disability after initial RRMS course
- **Primary Progressive MS (PPMS):** Progressive accumulation from onset without discrete relapses (~15%)
- **Relapse (Exacerbation):** New or worsening neurologic symptoms lasting >24 hours without fever/infection
- **NEDA (No Evidence of Disease Activity):** No relapses, no disability progression, no new/enlarging MRI lesions
- **Highly Active MS:** Frequent relapses (≥2/year), rapid disability progression, highly active MRI

## NOTES

- MS is a heterogeneous disease requiring individualized treatment
- "Treat early, treat effectively" philosophy - high-efficacy therapy increasingly used first-line
- NEDA (No Evidence of Disease Activity) is aspirational goal: no relapses, no progression, no MRI activity
- DMT escalation indicated for breakthrough disease (relapses, new MRI lesions, progression)
- PML risk with natalizumab: JCV+, prior immunosuppression, and duration >2 years are major risk factors
- S1P receptor modulators (fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod, ponesimod) require first-dose cardiac monitoring (less for ozanimod)
- Anti-CD20 therapies (ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ublituximab) very effective but infection risk
- Alemtuzumab highly effective but requires 4+ years of monthly monitoring for autoimmune complications
- Pregnancy: Most DMTs contraindicated; glatiramer acetate considered safest; natalizumab continued in high-risk cases
- Many symptoms (fatigue, bladder, spasticity, pain) significantly impact quality of life and are treatable
