**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** February 8, 2026
**REVISED:** February 8, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

**DIAGNOSIS:** Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)

**ICD-10:** G90.A (Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC), 80048 (BMP), 84443 (TSH), 83540 (Iron, serum), 83550 (Iron binding capacity/TIBC), 82728 (Ferritin), 82382 (Catecholamines, fractionated), 84681 (C-peptide), 86235 (ANA), 86364 (Anti-nuclear antibody/tissue transglutaminase IgA), 83516 (Immunoassay — ganglionic AChR Ab), 95924 (Autonomic function testing, including tilt table), 95923 (QSART, quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test), 95922 (Valsalva maneuver with HR/BP monitoring), 93000 (12-lead ECG), 93306 (Transthoracic echocardiogram), 95816 (EEG), 70553 (MRI brain with/without contrast), 72156 (MRI cervical spine), 88305 (Skin biopsy pathology — IENFD), 82533 (Cortisol), 82785 (Tryptase)

**SYNONYMS:** POTS, postural tachycardia syndrome, postural orthostatic tachycardia, orthostatic intolerance, chronic orthostatic intolerance, dysautonomia, hyperadrenergic POTS, neuropathic POTS, hypovolemic POTS, deconditioning POTS, orthostatic tachycardia

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of POTS in adolescents and adults. Includes diagnostic criteria, autonomic testing, subtype classification (hyperadrenergic, neuropathic, hypovolemic/deconditioning), and pharmacologic/non-pharmacologic treatment. Covers ED presentation for acute decompensation, inpatient management, and outpatient chronic management. Excludes other causes of orthostatic intolerance unless part of differential.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **POTS:** Sustained heart rate increase of >=30 bpm (or >=40 bpm in ages 12-19) within 10 minutes of standing or head-up tilt, in the absence of orthostatic hypotension (SBP drop >=20 mmHg), with symptoms present for >=3 months
- **Hyperadrenergic POTS:** Subtype with standing norepinephrine >600 pg/mL; often accompanied by SBP increase >=10 mmHg on standing, tremor, and anxiety
- **Neuropathic POTS:** Subtype associated with peripheral small fiber neuropathy and sudomotor dysfunction; abnormal QSART or skin biopsy
- **Hypovolemic/Deconditioning POTS:** Subtype characterized by low blood volume, low 24-hour urine sodium, and reduced cardiac stroke volume; often associated with prolonged bedrest or deconditioning
- **Orthostatic intolerance:** Symptoms provoked by upright posture (lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, visual blurring, presyncope, cognitive difficulty) relieved by recumbency
- **Active stand test:** Patient stands from supine; HR and BP measured at 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes; diagnostic if HR increment >=30 bpm (>=40 bpm ages 12-19) without orthostatic hypotension

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Disposition | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Discharge from ED | Confirmed POTS exacerbation with HR response to IV fluids; stable orthostatic vitals post-hydration; no syncope in ED; cardiac arrhythmia excluded; tolerating oral fluids; reliable outpatient follow-up arranged |
| Observation (ED short stay) | POTS flare requiring IV hydration with incomplete symptom resolution; awaiting initial cardiac workup (ECG, troponin, echo); first-time presentation requiring diagnostic evaluation |
| Admit to floor | Severe decompensation with recurrent presyncope/syncope despite IV fluids; unable to tolerate oral intake; need for telemetry to exclude arrhythmia; new-onset POTS requiring inpatient autonomic workup; comorbid condition requiring inpatient management |
| Admit to ICU/monitored bed | Hemodynamic instability not responding to volume resuscitation; sustained HR >150 bpm with concern for arrhythmia; syncope with injury requiring monitoring; concurrent critical illness triggering POTS decompensation |
| Outpatient follow-up (autonomic specialist) | All newly diagnosed POTS: autonomic neurology within 2-4 weeks; established POTS with stable management: q3-6 months; post-medication titration: 2-4 weeks |
| Outpatient follow-up (PCP/cardiology) | Medication monitoring q2-4 weeks during titration; stable patients q3-6 months; annual echocardiogram if structural concern; exercise program reassessment q3 months |

## NOTES

- POTS predominantly affects women (5:1 ratio) aged 15-50 years; onset often follows viral illness, surgery, pregnancy, or trauma
- Diagnosis requires symptoms to be present for >=3 months to distinguish from transient post-illness orthostatic tachycardia
- POTS is NOT a diagnosis of exclusion; it requires meeting specific hemodynamic criteria on active stand or tilt table testing
- Common comorbidities include Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hypermobile type), mast cell activation syndrome, small fiber neuropathy, chronic fatigue, and migraine
- Non-pharmacologic measures (fluids, salt, compression, exercise) are the foundation and should be maximized before pharmacotherapy
- Low-dose beta-blockers are preferred; high doses worsen fatigue and exercise intolerance
- Ivabradine is increasingly used as first-line for rate control due to favorable side effect profile and lack of hypotensive effect
- Hyperadrenergic subtype responds best to central sympatholytics (clonidine, methyldopa) and low-dose beta-blockers
- Deconditioning is both a cause and consequence of POTS; structured exercise is the most effective long-term intervention
- Avoid iatrogenic harm: excessive IV fluids, unnecessary beta-blocker doses, or labeling as anxiety/panic disorder without proper autonomic testing
- Many patients require combination therapy targeting multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms
