Covers recognition of impending respiratory failure, monitoring parameters (FVC, NIF), indications for intubation, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) considerations, disease-specific treatments (myasthenia gravis crisis, GBS, ALS, muscular dystrophy, other myopathies), and weaning considerations. Excludes central causes of respiratory failure (brainstem stroke, sedative overdose) and primary pulmonary causes (pneumonia, ARDS, COPD exacerbation).",
