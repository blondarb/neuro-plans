# Parkinson's Disease — Psychosis

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** February 9, 2026
**REVISED:** February 9, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Parkinson's Disease Psychosis (PDP)

**ICD-10:** F06.0 (Psychotic disorder due to known physiological condition with hallucinations), F06.2 (Psychotic disorder due to known physiological condition with delusions), G20.A1 (Parkinson's disease without dyskinesia, without fluctuations), G20.C (Parkinsonism, unspecified), F03.90 (Dementia, unspecified, without behavioral disturbance)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC), 80048 (BMP), 80053 (CMP), 84443 (TSH), 82607 (Vitamin B12), 81001 (Urinalysis), 81003 (UA automated), 36415 (Venipuncture), 82570 (Creatinine clearance), 80307 (Drug screen quantitative), 70553 (MRI brain with/without contrast), 70551 (MRI brain without contrast), 70450 (CT head without contrast), 95816 (EEG routine), 95819 (EEG with sleep), 96130 (Neuropsychological evaluation), 96132 (Neuropsychological testing by psychologist), 99213 (Office visit established), 99214 (Office visit established moderate complexity), 99215 (Office visit established high complexity), 99223 (Initial hospital care high complexity), 99233 (Subsequent hospital care high complexity)

**SYNONYMS:** Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP), parkinsonian psychosis, levodopa psychosis, dopaminergic psychosis, PD hallucinations, PD-associated psychosis, psychosis in Parkinson disease, Parkinson-related hallucinations and delusions

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of psychosis in the setting of Parkinson's disease. Covers the full spectrum from minor visual hallucinations (passage hallucinations, presence hallucinations) to formed visual hallucinations, delusions (paranoid, jealousy), and delirium. Includes medication-induced psychosis, PD dementia-related psychosis, and intercurrent medical causes. Addresses the critical tension between treating psychosis (requires dopamine reduction) and maintaining motor function (requires dopamine). Applies to ED (acute psychosis), inpatient (severe, disruptive), and outpatient (chronic management) settings.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP):** Recurrent or continuous psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, illusions) occurring in a patient with established PD; present for ≥1 month; after exclusion of other causes; may occur with clear or impaired sensorium (NINDS/NIMH criteria)
- **Minor psychotic phenomena:** Passage hallucinations (sense of something passing in peripheral vision), presence hallucinations (sense of someone nearby), vivid dreaming — often early harbingers of PDP; typically retain insight; do not always require treatment
- **Formed visual hallucinations:** The hallmark of PDP — detailed visual images of people, animals, or objects; often stereotyped; patient may or may not retain insight; typically non-threatening initially
- **Retained insight:** Patient recognizes hallucinations as not real — earlier stages; treatment may not be needed if non-distressing
- **Lost insight:** Patient believes hallucinations are real — signals progression; often accompanied by paranoid delusions; usually requires active treatment
- **Dopamine imbalance model:** PDP arises from the interplay of exogenous dopaminergic medication (serotonergic 5-HT2A activity) + progressive neurodegeneration (cortical Lewy pathology, cholinergic deficits, altered serotonergic signaling)

## Section 1: Laboratory Workup

### 1A — Core Labs (Order for All Patients)

| Test | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale |
|------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|
| CBC with differential | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | - | Infection screen (UTI, pneumonia — most common delirium triggers) |
| BMP (Na, K, Cl, CO₂, BUN, Cr, glucose) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | - | Metabolic derangements (hyponatremia, uremia, hypoglycemia) as cause of altered mental status |
| Urinalysis with culture | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | - | UTI — most common precipitant of delirium and acute psychotic worsening in elderly PD patients |
| TSH | URGENT | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism — exacerbates cognitive symptoms |
| Vitamin B12 | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Deficiency contributes to cognitive decline and psychiatric symptoms |
| Liver function tests (CMP) | URGENT | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Hepatic encephalopathy; drug metabolism assessment (many PD meds hepatically cleared) |
| Blood cultures (if febrile) | STAT | STAT | - | - | Sepsis — common cause of acute psychosis in elderly |

### 1B — Extended Labs (Order When Clinically Indicated)

| Test | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale |
|------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|
| Urine drug screen | STAT | STAT | - | - | If substance use suspected; may detect unexpected medications |
| Medication levels (if applicable) | URGENT | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Amantadine, lithium, anticonvulsant levels — toxicity can cause psychosis |
| Ammonia level | URGENT | URGENT | - | - | Hepatic encephalopathy if liver disease suspected |
| RPR/VDRL | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Neurosyphilis — treatable cause of psychosis in appropriate clinical context |
| HIV testing | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | If risk factors present — HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder |
| Cortisol (AM) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Adrenal insufficiency — especially if on chronic steroids |

### 1C — Rare/Specialized Labs

| Test | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale |
|------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|
| Autoimmune encephalitis panel | - | ROUTINE | EXT | - | If atypical course, rapid onset, or young patient — anti-NMDAR, LGI1, CASPR2 antibodies |
| Paraneoplastic antibody panel | - | ROUTINE | EXT | - | If subacute onset, associated neurologic findings suggesting paraneoplastic process |
| CSF analysis (cell count, protein, glucose, cytology) | - | EXT | - | - | Only if infection or autoimmune encephalitis is on differential — not routine for PDP |

---

## Section 2: Diagnostic Imaging & Studies

### 2A — Essential Imaging

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|
| CT head without contrast | STAT | STAT | - | - | Acute change in mental status — rule out stroke, subdural hematoma, hydrocephalus; first-line imaging |
| Chest X-ray | STAT | STAT | - | - | Pneumonia screen (common delirium trigger in elderly PD patients) |
| ECG (12-lead) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | - | QTc assessment **before starting pimavanserin** (prolongs QTc); baseline for antipsychotic monitoring |

### 2B — Extended Imaging

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|
| MRI brain with/without contrast | - | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Structural lesion, stroke, NPH, Lewy body pattern atrophy; indicated if new or atypical psychosis, rapid cognitive decline, or focal neurologic signs |
| EEG (routine or continuous) | - | URGENT | EXT | - | If concern for nonconvulsive seizures or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; periodic discharges in CJD |

### 2C — Rare/Specialized Studies

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|
| DaTscan (I-123 ioflupane SPECT) | - | - | EXT | - | Only if PD diagnosis is uncertain and DLB vs AD vs PD-D needs clarification; not routinely needed if PD diagnosis established |
| FDG-PET brain | - | - | EXT | - | Research/atypical cases — posterior cortical hypometabolism supports DLB/PDD |
| Neuropsychological testing | - | - | ROUTINE | - | Quantify cognitive deficits; distinguish PD-MCI from PDD; track progression; help predict psychosis risk |
| Polysomnography | - | - | EXT | - | If RBD evaluation needed or if sleep fragmentation contributing to psychotic symptoms |

## Section 3: Treatment

> **CARDINAL RULE:** In PDP, **never** use first-generation antipsychotics (haloperidol) or most second-generation antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone). These block D2 receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway, causing catastrophic motor worsening — parkinsonism crisis, rigidity, neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Only three antipsychotics have evidence for use in PDP: **pimavanserin, clozapine, and quetiapine** (in that order of evidence).

### 3A — Acute / Emergency Treatment

> **Step 1: Identify and treat precipitants FIRST**

| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Rule out delirium** | UTI, pneumonia, constipation/fecal impaction, medication changes, hospitalization itself — treat the underlying cause; psychosis may resolve entirely |
| **Medication review — eliminate offending agents** | Systematic deprescribing in order of cognitive risk (stop first → stop last): **anticholinergics** (benztropine, trihexyphenidyl) → **amantadine** → **MAO-B inhibitors** (selegiline, rasagiline) → **dopamine agonists** (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine) → **COMT inhibitors** (entacapone) → **reduce levodopa dose** (last resort — maintain motor function) |
| **Environmental measures** | Adequate lighting (reduce visual hallucinations), familiar objects, reorientation, sleep hygiene, minimize polypharmacy |

**If acute agitation requires pharmacologic intervention:**

| Medication | Dose | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Quetiapine PO | 12.5-25 mg :: PO :: as needed :: start 12.5 mg, may repeat in 2 hours | **First-line for acute agitation in PDP** — lowest D2 affinity among available agents; sedating at low doses; avoid IM formulation |
| Lorazepam | 0.5-1 mg :: PO/IV/IM :: as needed | **If severe agitation** — benzodiazepine safer than typical antipsychotic for acute PDP agitation; use lowest effective dose; fall risk |

> **NEVER give:** haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, or any other typical/atypical antipsychotic (except quetiapine/clozapine/pimavanserin) to a patient with PD or DLB. Even one dose can precipitate severe rigidity, akinetic crisis, or NMS-like syndrome.

### 3B — First-Line Chronic Treatment

| Medication | Dose | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Pimavanserin (Nuplazid) | 34 mg :: PO :: once daily :: no titration needed | **Only FDA-approved medication for PDP** (2016); selective 5-HT2A inverse agonist; **no D2 blockade** — does not worsen motor symptoms; onset of effect 4-6 weeks; **QTc prolongation risk** — obtain baseline ECG, avoid if QTc >500 ms; avoid with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors; no dose adjustment in renal impairment; cost is significant — prior authorization usually required |
| Quetiapine PO (chronic) | 12.5-150 mg :: PO :: at bedtime :: start 12.5 mg, titrate by 12.5-25 mg every 3-5 days; target lowest effective dose | Best-studied alternative to pimavanserin; AAN practice parameter notes limited evidence but wide clinical use; very low D2 affinity at low doses; sedation may benefit sleep; metabolic monitoring needed; orthostatic hypotension risk (already a PD issue); typical effective range 25-100 mg qhs |

### 3C — Second-Line Treatment

| Medication | Dose | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Clozapine PO | 6.25-50 mg :: PO :: at bedtime :: start 6.25 mg (1/4 of 25 mg tablet), titrate by 6.25 mg every 3-7 days; target 12.5-50 mg/day | **Best evidence for efficacy** in PDP (Level B, AAN); low D2 affinity; effective at very low doses in PDP; **MAJOR LIMITATION: requires REMS program enrollment, mandatory ANC monitoring** (weekly x6 months, then biweekly x6 months, then monthly); risk of agranulocytosis (~1%); risk of myocarditis (rare); metabolic syndrome; sedation; sialorrhea |
| Cholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, donepezil) | Rivastigmine :: 1.5 mg :: PO :: BID :: titrate by 1.5 mg every 2 weeks to 6 mg BID; or rivastigmine patch 4.6 mg/24h → 9.5 mg/24h → 13.3 mg/24h | Evidence supports use in **PD dementia with psychosis** — addresses underlying cholinergic deficit; rivastigmine preferred (best evidence in PDD — EXPRESS trial); may reduce hallucinations as secondary benefit; GI side effects common with oral; patch better tolerated; tremor may transiently worsen |

### 3D — Refractory Psychosis Management

| Approach | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Combination therapy** | Pimavanserin + quetiapine (or + clozapine) — limited evidence but used in practice for severe cases |
| **Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)** | Case reports/small series show benefit for severe PDP refractory to medications; also improves motor symptoms temporarily; logistic and access barriers |
| **Reduce levodopa** | If all else fails, gradually reduce levodopa — accept some motor worsening to control psychosis; family discussion about trade-offs essential |
| **Structured care environment** | If psychosis is persistent and dangerous — consider memory care or psychiatric facility with movement disorder expertise |

> **Avoid in PDP:**
> - Haloperidol (any dose, any route — catastrophic motor worsening)
> - Risperidone (significant D2 blockade — worsens PD)
> - Olanzapine (RCT showed motor worsening without psychosis benefit in PDP — Ondo 2002)
> - Aripiprazole (partial D2 agonist — worsens PD motor symptoms)
> - Ziprasidone (D2 blockade, QTc risk)
> - Metoclopramide (D2 blocker — parkinsonian crisis)

## Section 4: Other Recommendations

### 4A — Referrals

| Referral | Setting | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Movement disorder specialist (neurology) | OPD | PDP medication optimization — balance motor and psychiatric symptoms; pimavanserin initiation; clozapine program enrollment |
| Psychiatry (geriatric preferred) | HOSP/OPD | Severe psychosis, medication-refractory symptoms, ECT evaluation, capacity assessment |
| Neuropsychology | OPD | Cognitive testing — PD-MCI vs PDD staging; psychosis risk stratification; capacity evaluation |
| Social work / case management | HOSP/OPD | Caregiver support, home safety evaluation, placement assistance if needed |
| Palliative care | HOSP/OPD | Goals of care discussion if advanced PDD with refractory psychosis — quality of life focus |

### 4B — Patient and Family Instructions

- **Explain the diagnosis:** Hallucinations and false beliefs are a recognized part of Parkinson's disease — they occur in up to 50% of PD patients over the course of the disease; this is not a separate mental illness
- **Common triggers to monitor:** UTI, constipation, poor sleep, new medications (even non-neurologic), dehydration, hospitalization
- **When to seek immediate care:** If patient becomes aggressive, confused, unable to eat/drink, has falls, fever, or sudden worsening
- **Medication safety:** Never stop PD medications abruptly (risk of neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome); never allow ER physicians to give haloperidol for agitation — provide a medication alert card
- **Caregiver education:** Hallucinations are real to the patient — do not argue or confront; gently redirect; keep environment well-lit; maintain routine
- **Driving:** Psychosis symptoms (even minor hallucinations) may impair driving safety — formal assessment recommended
- **Advance care planning:** Discuss goals of care while patient retains capacity; PDP often signals disease progression toward dementia

### 4C — Lifestyle and Environmental Modifications

- **Lighting:** Keep rooms well-lit, especially at dusk ("sundowning" effect); nightlights in all rooms; reduce visual clutter that may provoke misperceptions
- **Sleep hygiene:** Consistent sleep-wake schedule; treat RBD if present; avoid daytime oversedation; consider melatonin 3-6 mg for circadian rhythm support
- **Reduce anticholinergic burden:** Review all medications (including OTC — diphenhydramine, antihistamines) for anticholinergic effects
- **Fall prevention:** Home safety evaluation — remove rugs, install grab bars; psychosis + orthostatic hypotension + motor impairment = very high fall risk
- **Cognitive stimulation:** Structured activities, social engagement, cognitive exercises — may slow progression

## Section 5: Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Key Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Delirium (non-PDP)** | Acute onset, fluctuating attention, identifiable precipitant (infection, metabolic); may look identical to PDP exacerbation — always rule out medical causes first |
| **Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)** | Hallucinations precede or occur simultaneously with parkinsonism (vs PDP where PD precedes psychosis by ≥1 year — the "1-year rule"); cognitive fluctuations more prominent; RBD often precedes |
| **Alzheimer disease with psychosis** | Hallucinations typically later stage; memory impairment more prominent than motor; less vivid visual hallucinations; delusions often paranoid/theft-related |
| **Charles Bonnet syndrome** | Visual hallucinations in setting of visual impairment (macular degeneration, glaucoma); patient typically retains full insight; no PD motor features |
| **REM sleep behavior disorder** | Vivid dreams, acting out during sleep; patient recognizes dream vs reality when fully awake; common in PD; may merge into waking hallucinations |
| **Peduncular hallucinosis** | Visual hallucinations from brainstem/thalamic lesion (often stroke); typically vivid, complex; MRI shows structural lesion |
| **Drug-induced psychosis (non-PD meds)** | Steroids, anticholinergics, opioids, benzodiazepines, fluoroquinolones — review all medications |
| **Seizure-related psychosis** | Temporal lobe seizures can cause hallucinations and psychosis; EEG may clarify; consider if episodic |
| **Primary psychiatric disorder** | Late-onset schizophrenia or delusional disorder — rare but possible; typically auditory (not visual) hallucinations; no parkinsonian features |
| **Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)** | Rapidly progressive dementia with myoclonus, psychiatric symptoms; periodic sharp waves on EEG; MRI shows cortical ribboning |

---

## Section 6: Monitoring Parameters

| Parameter | Frequency | Target/Goal |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Psychosis severity (NPI hallucination/delusion subscales)** | Each visit | Reduction in hallucination frequency, severity, and caregiver distress; retained insight |
| **Motor function (UPDRS Part III)** | Each visit | Stable motor function — no worsening with antipsychotic changes |
| **ECG / QTc** | Baseline, 2 weeks after starting pimavanserin, then every 6-12 months | QTc <500 ms; discontinue pimavanserin if QTc >500 ms or symptomatic arrhythmia |
| **CBC with ANC (clozapine only)** | Weekly x 6 months → biweekly x 6 months → monthly thereafter | ANC >1500/mm³ (general population); >1000/mm³ (benign ethnic neutropenia); discontinue if ANC <500 |
| **Metabolic panel (weight, glucose, lipids)** | Baseline, 3 months, then annually (quetiapine/clozapine) | Monitor for metabolic syndrome — weight gain, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia |
| **Orthostatic vital signs** | Each visit | PD + antipsychotics + PDP = high orthostatic hypotension risk; falls prevention |
| **Cognitive assessment (MoCA or MMSE)** | Every 6-12 months | Track cognitive trajectory — PDP accelerates cognitive decline |
| **Caregiver burden assessment** | Every 6-12 months | Zarit Burden Interview or similar — identify burnout; arrange respite care |
| **Cholinesterase inhibitor tolerability** | 2-4 weeks after each titration | GI side effects, tremor exacerbation, bradycardia |
| **Falls tracking** | Each visit | Document fall frequency — psychosis, orthostasis, and motor impairment create synergistic fall risk |

## Notes

- **The psychosis spectrum in PD is a continuum** — from minor phenomena (passage, presence hallucinations, vivid dreams) → formed visual hallucinations with retained insight → hallucinations with lost insight → paranoid delusions → delirium. Each stage requires re-evaluation of treatment approach.
- **PDP is a marker of disease progression** — development of PDP is associated with faster cognitive decline, increased mortality, nursing home placement, and caregiver burden. It should trigger advance care planning discussions.
- **"Start low, go slow" is essential** — PD patients are exquisitely sensitive to dopamine blockade; even quetiapine at standard psychiatric doses (300-600 mg) would be catastrophic. Therapeutic doses in PDP are typically 1/10 to 1/4 of standard psychiatric doses.
- **The 1-year rule (DLB vs PDD):** If cognitive/psychiatric symptoms precede motor symptoms by >1 year, diagnosis is DLB. If motor symptoms precede by >1 year, diagnosis is PDD. This distinction matters for prognosis but management of psychosis is similar.
- **Pimavanserin black box warning** — carries the standard antipsychotic class black box for increased mortality in elderly dementia patients. However, given the lack of alternatives, it remains the best-evidence option for PDP. Discuss risk-benefit with family.
- **Medication alert card** — all PDP patients should carry a card stating "I have Parkinson's disease. DO NOT give me haloperidol, droperidol, metoclopramide, or prochlorperazine. These medications are dangerous for me."
- **Hospitalization is a high-risk period** — PD medications given off-schedule, anticholinergics for urinary symptoms, promethazine for nausea, sleep aids, and the stress of hospitalization frequently precipitate or worsen PDP. Advocate for home medication schedules.
