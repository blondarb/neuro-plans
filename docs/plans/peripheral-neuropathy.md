# Peripheral Neuropathy - New Diagnosis/Evaluation

**VERSION:** 1.2  
**CREATED:** January 14, 2026  
**REVISED:** January 14, 2026  
**STATUS:** Revised per physician feedback

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Peripheral Neuropathy - New Diagnosis/Evaluation

**ICD-10:** G62.9 (Polyneuropathy, unspecified); G60.0 (Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy); G60.9 (Hereditary and idiopathic neuropathy, unspecified); G62.0 (Drug-induced polyneuropathy); G62.1 (Alcoholic polyneuropathy); G63 (Polyneuropathy in diseases classified elsewhere)

**SYNONYMS:** Peripheral neuropathy, polyneuropathy, neuropathy, peripheral nerve disease, neuropathic disorder, sensorimotor neuropathy, distal symmetric polyneuropathy, DSPN, axonal neuropathy, demyelinating neuropathy, nerve damage

**SCOPE:** Initial diagnostic workup and symptomatic management of suspected or newly diagnosed peripheral neuropathy. Covers etiologic evaluation, electrodiagnostic testing, pain management, and lifestyle modifications. For acute inflammatory neuropathies (GBS, CIDP), use dedicated templates. For diabetic neuropathy-specific management, this template applies but see also diabetes care protocols for glycemic optimization.
