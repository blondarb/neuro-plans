# Peripheral Neuropathy - New Diagnosis/Evaluation

**VERSION:** 2.0
**CREATED:** January 14, 2026
**REVISED:** January 24, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Peripheral Neuropathy - New Diagnosis/Evaluation

**ICD-10:** G62.9 (Polyneuropathy, unspecified); G60.9 (Hereditary and idiopathic neuropathy, unspecified); G62.0 (Drug-induced polyneuropathy); G62.1 (Alcoholic polyneuropathy); G63 (Polyneuropathy in diseases classified elsewhere); E11.42 (Type 2 diabetes with diabetic polyneuropathy); E10.42 (Type 1 diabetes with diabetic polyneuropathy); G60.0 (Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy - CMT); E85.1 (Neuropathic heredofamilial amyloidosis - hATTR)

**CLINICAL SYNONYMS:** Peripheral neuropathy, polyneuropathy, peripheral nerve disease, neuropathic disorder, sensorimotor neuropathy, axonal neuropathy, demyelinating neuropathy, distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP), length-dependent neuropathy, small fiber neuropathy (SFN), large fiber neuropathy, mixed fiber neuropathy, sensory neuropathy, motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, painful neuropathy

**SCOPE:** Initial diagnostic workup and symptomatic management of suspected or newly diagnosed peripheral neuropathy. Covers etiologic evaluation, electrodiagnostic testing, pain management, and lifestyle modifications. For acute inflammatory neuropathies (GBS, CIDP), use dedicated templates. For diabetic neuropathy-specific management, this template applies but see also diabetes care protocols for glycemic optimization.
