# Syncope Evaluation

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 29, 2026
**REVISED:** January 29, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Syncope

**ICD-10:** R55 (Syncope and collapse), T67.1 (Heat syncope), G90.01 (Carotid sinus syncope), I95.1 (Orthostatic hypotension)

**CPT CODES:** 82962 (Fingerstick glucose), 85025 (CBC), 80048 (BMP), 84484 (Troponin), 83880 (BNP or NT-proBNP), 84443 (TSH), 82533 (Cortisol), 85379 (D-dimer), 87040 (Blood cultures), 93000 (12-lead ECG), 93306 (Transthoracic echocardiogram), 93224 (Holter monitor), 93268 (Event recorder), 95924 (Tilt table test), 70450 (CT head), 70551 (MRI brain), 95816 (EEG)

**SYNONYMS:** Syncope, fainting, loss of consciousness, LOC, passing out, blackout, vasovagal syncope, neurocardiogenic syncope, reflex syncope, orthostatic syncope, cardiac syncope, convulsive syncope, presyncope, near-syncope, near syncope, TLOC, transient loss of consciousness

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) due to syncope in adults. Includes risk stratification, etiologic workup, and treatment by type. Applies to ED, hospital, and outpatient settings. Excludes seizure, stroke, metabolic causes, and traumatic loss of consciousness.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Syncope:** Transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) due to transient global cerebral hypoperfusion; characterized by rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous complete recovery
- **Presyncope:** Prodromal symptoms (lightheadedness, warmth, nausea) without loss of consciousness
- **Reflex (Neurally-Mediated) Syncope:** Most common; includes vasovagal, situational, carotid sinus syncope
- **Orthostatic Syncope:** Due to orthostatic hypotension from autonomic failure, hypovolemia, or medications
- **Cardiac Syncope:** Due to arrhythmia or structural heart disease; highest mortality risk
- **Convulsive Syncope:** Syncope with brief myoclonic jerks (not epilepsy); due to cerebral hypoperfusion

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

## NOTES

- Syncope is common (1-3% of ED visits); most are benign reflex syncope
- Cardiac syncope has highest mortality (up to 30% at 1 year); must be ruled out
- The history is the most important diagnostic tool (triggers, prodrome, position, witnesses)
- "Red flags" for cardiac syncope: exertional, supine, no prodrome, family history SCD, structural heart disease
- ECG is mandatory for ALL syncope patients
- Routine neuroimaging (CT, MRI) is NOT indicated for typical syncope without focal signs
- EEG is NOT indicated unless seizure is suspected
- Convulsive syncope (brief myoclonic jerks) is common and does NOT indicate epilepsy
- Insertable loop recorder (ILR) has high diagnostic yield for unexplained recurrent syncope
- Driving restrictions vary by state/country; counsel patients appropriately
- Many patients do not require extensive workup if history clearly suggests vasovagal syncope
