**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Essential Tremor:** Bilateral action tremor of the hands and forearms (± head tremor) without other neurologic signs, present for ≥3 years
- **Action Tremor:** Tremor occurring during voluntary movement (includes postural and kinetic tremor)
- **Postural Tremor:** Tremor present when maintaining a position against gravity (arms outstretched)
- **Kinetic Tremor:** Tremor during voluntary movement (finger-to-nose)
- **Rest Tremor:** Tremor present at rest with limb fully supported (typical of Parkinson's)

---

**DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (Consensus Statement, Movement Disorder Society):**

**Core Criteria:**
- Bilateral upper limb action tremor (postural ± kinetic) for ≥3 years
- With or without head tremor
- Without other neurologic signs (dystonia, ataxia, parkinsonism)

**Supportive Features:**

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Parkinson's disease | Rest tremor (4-6 Hz), asymmetric onset, bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability | Clinical exam; DaTscan reduced in PD |
| Enhanced physiologic tremor | Low amplitude, high frequency (8-12 Hz), associated with anxiety, caffeine, medications, hyperthyroidism | TSH, medication review, resolves with trigger removal |
| Drug-induced tremor | Temporal relationship to medication (lithium, valproate, SSRIs, stimulants, bronchodilators) | Medication review; improves with dose reduction |
| Dystonic tremor | Irregular, jerky, "null point" present, associated dystonic posturing | Clinical features; may respond to botox |
| Cerebellar tremor | Intention tremor worse at target, associated ataxia, dysmetria, other cerebellar signs | MRI brain; cerebellar atrophy/lesion |
| Wilson disease | Young onset (<50), KF rings, liver disease, psychiatric symptoms, varied movement disorders | Ceruloplasmin, 24h urine copper, slit lamp exam |
| Psychogenic tremor | Variable frequency, distractible, entrainment, inconsistent pattern, sudden onset | Clinical observation; psychiatric assessment |
| Orthostatic tremor | High frequency (13-18 Hz), occurs only when standing, relief with sitting/walking | EMG shows characteristic high frequency |
| Hyperthyroidism | Associated hyperthyroid symptoms (weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance) | TSH, free T4 |
| Rubral (Holmes) tremor | Combination of rest, postural, and action tremor; large amplitude; midbrain lesion | MRI brain showing midbrain pathology |

## 6. MONITORING PARAMETERS

| Parameter | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Frequency | Target/Threshold | Action if Abnormal |
|-----------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Tremor severity (clinical rating scale) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Each visit | Improved or stable | Adjust medications |
| Functional impact (FTM, QUEST) | - | - | ROUTINE | - | q6-12 months | Minimal functional impairment | Add therapy, consider surgery |
| Handwriting sample/spiral drawing | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Each visit | Stable or improved | Objective tracking |
| Heart rate | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Each visit if on beta-blocker | HR >50 | Reduce dose if bradycardic |
| Blood pressure | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Each visit if on beta-blocker | SBP >90 | Reduce dose if hypotensive |
| Sedation/cognitive effects | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Each visit | Tolerable | Reduce dose or switch agent |
| Mood | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Each visit | No depression | Monitor; beta-blockers can cause depression |
| TSH | - | - | ROUTINE | - | Annually if on medications | Normal | Adjust thyroid replacement if applicable |

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Disposition | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Outpatient management | Most patients; diagnosis confirmed, treatment initiated |
| Movement disorder referral | Diagnostic uncertainty, DaTscan consideration, treatment-refractory, surgical candidacy |
| DBS evaluation | Moderate-severe tremor refractory to medications, adequate cognitive function, no surgical contraindications |
| MRgFUS evaluation | Unilateral tremor dominant, medications failed, not DBS candidate, meets skull density criteria |
| Occupational therapy | Functional impairment with ADLs; need for adaptive equipment |

## NOTES

- Essential tremor is often underdiagnosed and undertreated
- Family history present in ~50% of cases; autosomal dominant inheritance pattern
- Alcohol responsiveness is characteristic but NOT a recommended treatment strategy
- Tremor typically starts in hands; head tremor develops in ~50% over time; voice tremor in ~30%
- Propranolol and primidone are first-line; start LOW and titrate SLOWLY with primidone
- Many patients respond partially to medications; combination therapy often needed
- DBS is highly effective for medication-refractory cases; VIM thalamus is target
- MRgFUS (focused ultrasound) is incisionless alternative but only unilateral treatment recommended
- ET is associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment and Parkinson's disease (controversial)
- Differentiation from PD is clinical; DaTscan helpful in uncertain cases
