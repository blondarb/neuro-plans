## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Eclampsia (primary diagnosis) | New-onset seizure in pregnancy/postpartum with hypertension (≥140/90) and proteinuria; >20 weeks gestation; may occur without preceding preeclampsia diagnosis | BP, urinalysis, preeclampsia labs; clinical diagnosis |
| PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) | Overlaps heavily with eclampsia; posterior cerebral edema on MRI; may occur with or without eclampsia | MRI (T2/FLAIR posterior predominant edema); DWI (vasogenic not cytotoxic edema); clinical overlap — treat both |

| Meningoencephalitis | Fever, headache, altered mental status, seizures; may be viral (HSV) or bacterial | CSF analysis; MRI (temporal lobe enhancement in HSV); cultures |
| Metabolic (hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia) | Correctable metabolic abnormalities; no hypertension/proteinuria | BMP; glucose; calcium; magnesium |

### Red Flags for Non-Eclamptic Cause

| Red Flag | Concern | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Seizure before 20 weeks gestation | Eclampsia rare <20 wks; consider epilepsy, structural lesion, metabolic | Full neurologic workup; MRI; EEG |
| Normal blood pressure with seizure | Not classic eclampsia (though 20% of eclampsia occurs with "normal" BP) | Consider CVT, epilepsy, metabolic; MRV; ASM levels |
| Focal neurologic deficit persistent >24h | Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic); CVT with infarction | MRI/DWI; MRV; CTA |
| Fever with seizure | Meningitis, encephalitis; chorioamnionitis | CSF analysis; blood cultures; MRI |
| Seizure >6 weeks postpartum | Late postpartum eclampsia possible but rare; consider CVT, epilepsy | Full workup as new-onset seizure; MRV |

## 6. MONITORING PARAMETERS

| Parameter | Frequency | Target/Threshold | Action if Abnormal | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Blood pressure | q5 min during acute treatment; q15 min x 2h; then q1h; q4h once stable | <160/110 acute; <150/100 target range; <140/90 postpartum | Persistent ≥160/110 → IV antihypertensive; resistant → ICU | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Magnesium level | q4-6h during infusion; q6h maintenance; PRN if toxicity signs | 4-7 mEq/L therapeutic | <4 → increase rate; >7 → decrease rate/hold; >10 → stop + calcium gluconate | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Deep tendon reflexes (patellar) | q1h during MgSO4 infusion | Present (2+) | Absent/diminished → check Mg level; hold MgSO4 if areflexic; have calcium gluconate ready | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Respiratory rate | q1h during MgSO4 | >12 breaths/min | <12 → hold MgSO4; administer calcium gluconate; prepare for intubation | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Urine output | q1h (Foley catheter recommended) | >25 mL/h (>0.5 mL/kg/h) | <25 mL/h → reduce MgSO4 (renal excretion); assess volume status; oliguria → fluid bolus vs renal failure | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Fetal heart rate | Continuous during acute management | 110-160 bpm; reactive | Non-reassuring → OB assessment; emergent delivery if persistent fetal distress | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| CBC with platelets | q6-12h if HELLP; daily if preeclampsia | Platelets >100K; stable Hgb | Falling platelets → worsening HELLP; Hgb drop → hemorrhage or hemolysis | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| LFTs (AST/ALT) | q6-12h if HELLP; daily if preeclampsia | Trending down after delivery | Rising → worsening HELLP; peak usually 24-48h after delivery then improve | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| LDH and haptoglobin | q12-24h if HELLP | LDH trending down; haptoglobin rising | Worsening → ongoing hemolysis; not improving 48-72h → consider TTP/aHUS | - | STAT | - | STAT |
| ASM levels (if epilepsy) | At admission; monthly during pregnancy; 1 week postpartum | Pre-pregnancy target level | Subtherapeutic → increase dose; postpartum → reduce dose (levels rebound) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Postpartum BP monitoring | Daily x 72h inpatient; home monitoring daily x 6 weeks | <140/90 | Persistent hypertension → continue/escalate antihypertensives; new onset >48h → evaluate late postpartum preeclampsia | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Disposition | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Admit to ICU | Eclamptic seizure; refractory hypertension (≥160/110 despite 2 IV agents); HELLP with platelets <50K or DIC; pulmonary edema; renal failure; persistent altered mental status; intubation |
| Admit to L&D / high-risk antepartum | Severe preeclampsia with controlled BP; stable HELLP (platelets >50K); post-eclamptic seizure now stable; pending delivery planning |
| Discharge home (postpartum) | Seizure-free ≥24h after MgSO4 completion; BP consistently <150/100 on oral agents; normalizing labs; oral medications tolerated; reliable follow-up arranged; home BP cuff provided |
| Outpatient follow-up | Neurology 2-4 weeks (MRI review, recurrence risk); OB 1-2 weeks (BP, proteinuria); MFM before future pregnancy for risk counseling |
| Transfer to tertiary center | If facility lacks MFM, NICU, or neurocritical care capabilities; HELLP with DIC; refractory status epilepticus in pregnancy |
