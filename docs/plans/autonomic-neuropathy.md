# Autonomic Neuropathy

**VERSION:** 1.2
**CREATED:** February 11, 2026
**REVISED:** February 11, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Autonomic Neuropathy

**ICD-10:** G90.09 (Other idiopathic peripheral autonomic neuropathy), G90.3 (Multi-system degeneration of the autonomic nervous system), G99.0 (Autonomic neuropathy in diseases classified elsewhere), G90.01 (Carotid sinus syncope)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC), 80053 (CMP), 84443 (TSH), 82728 (Ferritin), 83036 (HbA1c), 82607 (Vitamin B12), 86235 (ANA), 82382 (Catecholamines, fractionated), 82533 (Cortisol), 83516 (Ganglionic AChR Ab), 95924 (Autonomic function testing/tilt table), 95923 (QSART), 95922 (Valsalva maneuver), 93000 (12-lead ECG), 95907-95913 (NCS), 95860-95870 (EMG), 88305 (Skin biopsy — IENFD), 84681 (C-peptide), 70553 (MRI brain), 82784 (Immunoglobulins quantitative), 86255 (Antibody screen)

**SYNONYMS:** autonomic neuropathy, peripheral autonomic neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, autonomic failure, dysautonomia, pandysautonomia, autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, AAG, diabetic autonomic neuropathy, autonomic small fiber neuropathy, cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, sudomotor dysfunction, autonomic insufficiency

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of peripheral autonomic neuropathy in adults. Covers cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction (orthostatic hypotension, heart rate abnormalities), sudomotor dysfunction, gastrointestinal dysmotility, urogenital dysfunction, and pupillary abnormalities. Includes diabetic, autoimmune (AAG), paraneoplastic, amyloid, hereditary (HSAN/FAP), and toxic etiologies. Excludes central autonomic failure (MSA, pure autonomic failure) as primary diagnosis but includes in differential.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Orthostatic hypotension (OH):** Sustained SBP drop ≥20 mmHg or DBP drop ≥10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing or head-up tilt
- **Neurogenic OH:** OH caused by failure of norepinephrine release from sympathetic postganglionic neurons; distinguished from non-neurogenic by absent compensatory tachycardia
- **Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG):** Antibody-mediated autonomic failure due to ganglionic acetylcholine receptor (gAChR) antibodies
- **Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN):** Autonomic neuropathy affecting heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, and vascular tone; most common in diabetes
- **QSART:** Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test; measures postganglionic sympathetic cholinergic sudomotor function
- **Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS):** Standardized scoring of sudomotor, cardiovagal, and adrenergic domains (0-10)

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Multiple system atrophy (MSA) | Central autonomic failure; cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C) or parkinsonism (MSA-P); hot cross bun sign on MRI; progressive | MRI brain (hot cross bun sign, putaminal changes); cardiac MIBG (preserved in MSA vs reduced in Lewy body) |
| Pure autonomic failure (PAF) | Isolated peripheral autonomic failure without somatic neuropathy; no motor/sensory deficits; slowly progressive | Autonomic testing; NCS normal; plasma NE very low supine and standing; skin biopsy may show alpha-synuclein |
| POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) | HR rise ≥30 bpm without OH; predominantly younger females; no BP drop meeting OH criteria | Active stand test: HR rises ≥30 bpm without SBP drop ≥20 mmHg |
| Parkinson disease with autonomic failure | Parkinsonism precedes or accompanies autonomic symptoms; asymmetric tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia | DaTscan; clinical exam for parkinsonism; cardiac MIBG (reduced in PD) |
| Adrenal insufficiency | Orthostatic hypotension with hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hyperpigmentation, fatigue, weight loss | AM cortisol; ACTH stimulation test; ACTH level |
| Medication-induced autonomic dysfunction | Temporal relationship to medication; common offenders: antihypertensives, antidepressants, alpha-blockers, diuretics | Medication reconciliation; improvement with dose reduction/discontinuation |
| Dehydration / hypovolemia | OH and tachycardia resolving with volume repletion; identifiable cause (GI illness, poor intake) | Labs showing hemoconcentration; resolution with IV fluids |
| Amyloidosis (AL or hereditary) | Autonomic neuropathy with cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, hepatomegaly; peripheral neuropathy; macroglossia | SPEP/UPEP; free light chains; TTR gene testing; tissue biopsy with Congo red |
| Sjögren syndrome | Autonomic neuropathy with sicca symptoms (dry eyes, dry mouth); small fiber predominant | SSA/SSB antibodies; Schirmer test; lip biopsy; ANA |
| Paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy | Subacute onset; often with other paraneoplastic features; anti-Hu, anti-CRMP5 positive | Paraneoplastic antibody panel; CT/PET for occult malignancy |
| Diabetic autonomic neuropathy | Most common cause; concurrent length-dependent sensorimotor neuropathy; long-standing or poorly controlled diabetes | HbA1c; NCS/EMG showing distal sensorimotor neuropathy; autonomic testing |

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Disposition | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Discharge from ED | Orthostatic symptoms improved with hydration; no syncope in ED; stable vital signs; cardiac arrhythmia excluded; tolerating oral fluids; outpatient autonomic evaluation arranged |
| Admit to floor | Recurrent syncope despite IV fluids; unable to tolerate oral intake; new-onset severe autonomic failure requiring inpatient workup; severe gastroparesis with dehydration; need for cardiac monitoring |
| Admit to ICU | Hemodynamic instability not responding to volume and vasopressors; severe bradycardia or tachyarrhythmia from autonomic dysfunction; respiratory compromise; acute adrenal crisis |
| Outpatient follow-up (autonomic neurology) | All newly diagnosed: within 2-4 weeks for formal autonomic testing; established patients: q3-6 months; post-medication changes: 2-4 weeks |
| Outpatient follow-up (PCP/specialist) | Diabetic patients: endocrinology q3 months for glycemic optimization; GI follow-up for gastroparesis management; urology for bladder dysfunction |

## NOTES

- Diabetic autonomic neuropathy is the most common cause; cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is independently associated with increased cardiovascular mortality
- Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG) is a treatable cause — always check gAChR antibodies in acute/subacute onset autonomic failure
- Pure autonomic failure (PAF) may convert to MSA or Lewy body dementia over years; longitudinal monitoring recommended
- Orthostatic hypotension management requires balancing standing BP improvement against supine hypertension; head-of-bed elevation helps both
- Supine hypertension (SBP >160) is common in neurogenic OH patients and worsens target organ damage; avoid midodrine within 4 hours of bedtime
- Amyloidosis (AL or hereditary) should be suspected when autonomic neuropathy co-occurs with cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, or unexplained weight loss
- Multiple system atrophy has central autonomic failure that may mimic severe peripheral autonomic neuropathy; MRI and cardiac MIBG help distinguish
- Drug-induced autonomic dysfunction is common and reversible; always perform medication reconciliation before extensive workup
- Gastroparesis may be the presenting feature of autonomic neuropathy and can severely impact medication absorption and nutrition
- Many patients require combination therapy targeting multiple autonomic domains (cardiovascular, GI, urogenital)
