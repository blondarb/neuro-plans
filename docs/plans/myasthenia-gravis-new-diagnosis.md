**REVISED:** January 27, 2026
**STATUS:** Initial creation

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Myasthenia Gravis - New Diagnosis

## 6. MONITORING PARAMETERS

### 6A. Acute Monitoring (ED / Inpatient / ICU)

| Parameter | Frequency | Target/Threshold | Action if Abnormal |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Forced vital capacity (FVC) | Q4-6h in acute; Q shift if stable | >20 mL/kg (>1.5 L) | If <15 mL/kg or <1 L: impending respiratory failure, prepare for intubation; ICU transfer |
| Negative inspiratory force (NIF/MIP) | Q4-6h in acute; Q shift if stable | More negative than -40 cm H2O | If weaker than -20 cm H2O: intubate; -20 to -30 = ICU monitoring |
| Peak expiratory flow (PEF) | Q4-6h in acute | >200 L/min | Declining PEF = weakening respiratory muscles |
| Oxygen saturation (SpO2) | Continuous in acute | >94% | Supplemental O2; BiPAP; intubation if declining |
| Swallow function assessment | Daily; each meal if bulbar symptoms | Safe oral intake | NPO if aspiration risk; NG tube or modified diet; SLP consult |
| Neurologic exam (MG-specific) | Q shift inpatient; BID in ICU | Stable or improving strength | If worsening: reassess pyridostigmine dose; consider IVIG/PLEX; check for cholinergic crisis |

| Immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, IgM) | Q6 months if on rituximab/chronic immunosuppression | IgG >400 mg/dL | IVIG replacement if symptomatic hypogammaglobulinemia with recurrent infections |
| IgG level (if on FcRn inhibitor) | Before each treatment cycle | ~70% reduction expected during treatment | Guide retreatment timing; monitor for infection |

| Meningococcal infection surveillance (if on complement inhibitor) | Each visit; patient education | No signs of meningococcal disease | Emergency evaluation for fever, headache, neck stiffness, rash; ensure vaccination current; ciprofloxacin prophylaxis |
| Vitamin D level | Annually | >30 ng/mL | Supplement 2000-5000 IU daily |
| Thyroid function (TSH) | Annually (autoimmune overlap) | Normal | Endocrinology referral if abnormal |
