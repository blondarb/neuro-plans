## APPENDIX A: MRC SUM SCORE ASSESSMENT

**Medical Research Council (MRC) Sum Score for ICU-Acquired Weakness**

Assess 6 bilateral muscle groups (12 total assessments) on a 0-5 scale. Maximum score = 60.

| Muscle Group | Movement Tested | Right (0-5) | Left (0-5) |
|--------------|----------------|:-----------:|:----------:|
| Shoulder abduction | Deltoid | _ | _ |
| Elbow flexion | Biceps | _ | _ |
| Wrist extension | Wrist extensors | _ | _ |
| Hip flexion | Iliopsoas | _ | _ |
| Knee extension | Quadriceps | _ | _ |
| Ankle dorsiflexion | Tibialis anterior | _ | _ |

**MRC Grading Scale:**

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 0 | No visible contraction |
| 1 | Visible contraction without limb movement |
| 2 | Movement with gravity eliminated |
| 3 | Movement against gravity |
| 4 | Movement against gravity with some resistance |
| 5 | Normal strength |

**Interpretation:**

| Total Score | Interpretation |
|-------------|---------------|
| 60 | Normal strength |
| 48-59 | Mild weakness (not ICUAW) |
| <48 | ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) |
| <36 | Severe ICUAW |

**Requirements:** Patient must be awake and cooperative (RASS 0 to +1); GCS verbal component >=4; assess at least 3 consecutive sessions to confirm reliability.

## APPENDIX B: ELECTRODIAGNOSTIC DIFFERENTIATION OF CIM vs CIP

| Feature | CIM (Critical Illness Myopathy) | CIP (Critical Illness Polyneuropathy) | Combined CINM |
|---------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------|
| Motor NCS (CMAP) | Reduced amplitudes; may have prolonged duration | Reduced amplitudes | Reduced amplitudes |
| Sensory NCS (SNAP) | **NORMAL** (key differentiator) | **Reduced amplitudes** (axonal) | Reduced amplitudes |
| Conduction velocities | Normal | Normal or mildly reduced | Normal or mildly reduced |
| EMG (volitional) | Myopathic: small, polyphasic, early recruitment | Neuropathic: large, polyphasic, reduced recruitment, fibrillations | Mixed myopathic and neuropathic |
| Direct muscle stimulation (DMS) | Reduced nerve:muscle ratio (<0.5); reduced direct CMAP | Preserved nerve:muscle ratio; reduced CMAPs on both | Variable |
| CK level | Often elevated (1000-5000 IU/L) | Usually normal | Variably elevated |
| Sensory exam | Normal | Reduced distally (stocking-glove) | Reduced distally |
| Reflexes | Reduced or absent | Reduced or absent | Reduced or absent |
| Prognosis | Better; most recover in 3-6 months | Worse; recovery may take 6-12+ months; some have permanent deficits | Intermediate |
| Risk factors | Corticosteroids + NMBAs; high-dose steroids | Sepsis; multi-organ failure | Overlap of both risk profiles |
