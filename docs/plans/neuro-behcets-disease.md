Covers International Study Group (ISG) diagnostic criteria, International Criteria for Behcet's Disease (ICBD), HLA-B51 testing, pathergy test, acute immunotherapy, steroid-sparing agents, and biologic therapies (TNF inhibitors). Settings: ED, HOSP, OPD, ICU. For isolated mucocutaneous or ocular Behcet's disease without neurological involvement, defer to rheumatology/dermatology/ophthalmology. For other CNS vasculitides (e.g., PACNS, giant cell arteritis, neurosarcoidosis), use respective templates.

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Parenchymal Neuro-Behcet's (pNBD):** CNS parenchymal involvement, most commonly brainstem (diencephalic-brainstem junction), hemispheric white matter, or spinal cord; accounts for ~75-80% of NBD
- **Non-parenchymal Neuro-Behcet's (npNBD):** Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT), intracranial hypertension, or meningitis without parenchymal lesions; accounts for ~20-25% of NBD
- **International Study Group (ISG) Criteria for Behcet's Disease (1990):** Recurrent oral aphthous ulceration (>3 episodes in 12 months) PLUS at least 2 of: recurrent genital ulceration, eye lesions (uveitis, retinal vasculitis), skin lesions (erythema nodosum, pseudofolliculitis, papulopustular), or positive pathergy test

### LUMBAR PUNCTURE (CPT 62270)

**Indication:** Essential for suspected Neuro-Behcet's disease; CSF abnormalities support diagnosis and help distinguish parenchymal from non-parenchymal forms; excludes infectious meningitis and other inflammatory CNS diseases. In pNBD: CSF typically shows inflammatory profile. In npNBD with CVT: CSF opening pressure often elevated; cell count is frequently normal.

**Timing:** URGENT in ED/hospital setting; ROUTINE for outpatient workup. Perform after CT head to rule out mass effect. Use caution with LP in CVT -- elevated ICP is common; perform under controlled conditions.

**Volume Required:** 15-20 mL (sufficient for comprehensive infectious, inflammatory, and cytology studies)

| Study | Rationale | Target Finding | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-------|-----------|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Opening pressure (CPT 89050) | Elevated ICP common in npNBD (CVT); also elevated in pNBD | 10-20 cm H2O normal; often elevated >25 in CVT-type NBD | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

| TB PCR (GeneXpert) (CPT 87556) | Rapid TB meningitis exclusion; critical differential | Negative | URGENT | URGENT | ROUTINE | - |
| CSF ACE level (CPT 82164) | Neurosarcoidosis exclusion (important differential for pNBD) | Normal | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

**Special Handling:** CSF IL-6 requires prompt processing; send AFB and fungal cultures in sufficient volume (minimum 2 mL each). Cytology requires rapid transport (<1 hour). Store extra CSF (frozen at -20C) for future testing. Note opening pressure carefully as it distinguishes pNBD from npNBD.

**Contraindications:** Elevated ICP without imaging (get CT first); coagulopathy (INR >1.5, platelets <50K); skin infection at LP site; obstructive hydrocephalus with risk of herniation. Use caution in CVT (LP is therapeutic for elevated ICP but risk of herniation exists).

**Treatment Note:** For parenchymal NBD, high-dose IV corticosteroids are the mainstay of acute treatment. For non-parenchymal NBD (CVT), anticoagulation is the primary acute treatment (heparin), with steroids added if significant inflammation is present. Anticoagulation is indicated in CVT-type NBD even with hemorrhagic venous infarction. Do NOT delay treatment if NBD is clinically suspected -- tissue confirmation proceeds in parallel. Exclude TB meningitis before or concurrently with initiating immunosuppression.

**Treatment Note:** Symptomatic treatment addresses pain, seizures, spasticity, fatigue, bladder dysfunction, and mucocutaneous disease. Anticoagulation duration for CVT in Behcet's is controversial -- many experts recommend indefinite anticoagulation given the high recurrence rate of thrombosis in Behcet's disease. Co-manage mucocutaneous disease as mucocutaneous activity predicts neurological relapse.

**Treatment Note:** Azathioprine is the first-line steroid-sparing agent for Neuro-Behcet's disease based on the landmark Yazici et al. trial showing prevention of new attacks. Initiate azathioprine early (within 1-2 months) for all patients with pNBD. Cyclosporine, while effective for ocular Behcet's, is associated with increased risk of neurological involvement when used alone -- combine with azathioprine if used. Cyclophosphamide is reserved for severe/refractory cases.

**Treatment Note:** Anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab) have the strongest evidence for refractory Neuro-Behcet's disease. Infliximab is preferred for severe/refractory CNS disease. Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6) is a promising alternative given the critical role of IL-6 in NBD pathogenesis (elevated CSF IL-6 is a hallmark of active pNBD). Exclude latent TB before starting biologics. Treatment duration is typically years; relapse is common on discontinuation. Interferon-alpha is particularly effective for refractory ocular Behcet's with concurrent neurological involvement.

## CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT NOTES

### International Study Group (ISG) Criteria for Behcet's Disease (1990)

**Required:** Recurrent oral aphthous ulceration (>=3 episodes in 12 months)

**Plus at least 2 of the following:**
- [ ] Recurrent genital aphthous ulceration
- [ ] Eye lesions (anterior uveitis, posterior uveitis, cells in vitreous on slit lamp, or retinal vasculitis)
- [ ] Skin lesions (erythema nodosum, pseudofolliculitis, papulopustular lesions, or acneiform nodules)
- [ ] Positive pathergy test (read at 24-48 hours)

### International Criteria for Behcet's Disease (ICBD, 2014)

Point-based system (>=4 points = Behcet's disease):

| Manifestation | Points |
|---------------|--------|
| Oral aphthosis | 2 |
| Genital aphthosis | 2 |
| Ocular lesions (uveitis, retinal vasculitis) | 2 |
| Skin lesions (erythema nodosum, pseudofolliculitis, papulopustular) | 1 |
| Neurological manifestations | 1 |
| Vascular manifestations (arterial thrombosis, large vein thrombosis, phlebitis, superficial phlebitis) | 1 |
| Positive pathergy test* | 1 |

*Pathergy test: where it is performed (validity varies by geographic region)

### Parenchymal vs. Non-Parenchymal Neuro-Behcet's

| Feature | Parenchymal (pNBD) | Non-Parenchymal (npNBD) |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Frequency | 75-80% of NBD | 20-25% of NBD |
| Most common presentation | Brainstem syndrome (diencephalic-brainstem junction) | Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) |
| MRI findings | T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in brainstem, basal ganglia, hemispheric white matter | Venous sinus thrombosis on MRV; normal parenchyma possible |
| CSF findings | Pleocytosis (early neutrophilic, then lymphocytic); elevated protein; elevated IL-6 | Normal or mild pleocytosis; elevated opening pressure |
| Primary treatment | High-dose IV steroids + azathioprine | Anticoagulation (heparin then warfarin) +/- steroids |
| Prognosis | Moderate-poor; 30-50% have residual disability; relapsing course common | Generally better; dependent on recanalization and ICP control |
| Brainstem atrophy | Progressive in severe/relapsing cases (poor prognostic sign) | Not applicable |

### Common Presentations of Neuro-Behcet's Disease

| Presentation | Frequency | Key Features |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Brainstem syndrome | 50-60% of pNBD | Cranial neuropathies; pyramidal signs; ataxia; ophthalmoplegia; dysarthria; dysphagia; characteristic diencephalic-brainstem junction involvement |
| Hemispheric white matter | 15-20% of pNBD | Hemiparesis; hemisensory loss; cognitive impairment; mimics MS or stroke |
| Myelopathy | 5-15% of pNBD | Spastic paraparesis; sensory level; bladder dysfunction; longitudinally extensive possible |
| Cerebral venous thrombosis | 60-75% of npNBD | Headache; papilledema; elevated ICP; superior sagittal sinus most common; hemorrhagic venous infarct possible |
| Aseptic meningitis | 10-20% | Headache; fever; meningismus; CSF pleocytosis |
| Optic neuropathy | 5-10% | Visual loss; optic disc edema; bilateral possible; often with concurrent uveitis |
| Seizures | 5-10% | From cortical involvement; presenting feature of pNBD in some cases |
| Cognitive/psychiatric | 20-30% | Memory impairment; behavioral changes; apathy; executive dysfunction; progressive course possible |
| Peripheral neuropathy | Rare (<5%) | Sensorimotor polyneuropathy; less common than in other vasculitides |

### Red Flags Suggesting Neuro-Behcet's Disease

- [ ] Young male (20-40 years) from Silk Road region (Turkey, Iran, Japan, Korea, Middle East) with brainstem syndrome
- [ ] Recurrent oral ulcers + new neurological symptoms (especially brainstem signs)
- [ ] CVT in a patient with oral + genital ulcers
- [ ] Brainstem-diencephalic T2 lesion extending from midbrain to pons on MRI
- [ ] CSF neutrophilic pleocytosis converting to lymphocytic over days (unusual pattern)
- [ ] Elevated CSF IL-6 with brainstem syndrome
- [ ] Uveitis (especially hypopyon) + neurological symptoms
- [ ] Pathergy-positive patient with CNS symptoms
- [ ] HLA-B51 positive patient with mucocutaneous disease + neurological features
- [ ] Progressive brainstem atrophy on serial MRI (chronic pNBD)
- [ ] Recurrent CVT despite anticoagulation (suggests Behcet's systemic vasculitis as underlying cause)

### HLA-B51 and Pathergy Testing

**HLA-B51:**
- Present in 50-70% of Behcet's patients (varies by ethnicity; highest in Turkish/Middle Eastern populations)
- Relative risk: 5-6x increased risk of Behcet's disease if HLA-B51 positive
- NOT diagnostic alone (present in 15-20% of general population in endemic areas)
- Absence does NOT exclude Behcet's disease
- Correlates with more severe disease course (some studies)

**Pathergy Test:**
- Sterile needle prick (20-gauge) to forearm skin; read at 24-48 hours
- Positive: papule or pustule >=2mm at injection site
- Sensitivity varies by geography: 40-60% in Turkey/Middle East; <10% in Western Europe/North America
- Specificity ~95% in endemic populations
- Part of both ISG and ICBD criteria
- Less reliable with modern disposable needles (blunt-needle technique preferred)

---

## APPENDIX B: Treatment Algorithm for Neuro-Behcet's Disease

**Parenchymal NBD (pNBD):**
1. **Acute attack:** IV methylprednisolone 1g/day x 5-10 days
2. **Oral taper:** Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day, taper over 6-12 months
3. **Steroid-sparing (START EARLY):** Azathioprine 2.5 mg/kg/day (first-line)
4. **If azathioprine fails:** Add or switch to anti-TNF (infliximab preferred)
5. **If anti-TNF fails:** Cyclophosphamide IV monthly x 6 cycles, then azathioprine maintenance
6. **Refractory:** Tocilizumab, rituximab, or interferon-alpha

**Non-Parenchymal NBD (npNBD / CVT):**
1. **Acute:** Heparin anticoagulation (UFH or LMWH) -- even if hemorrhagic venous infarction
2. **Transition:** Warfarin (INR 2-3); duration 3-12 months (indefinite in recurrent thrombosis)
3. **ICP management:** Acetazolamide; LP if needed; VP shunt if refractory
4. **If inflammatory component:** Add corticosteroids
5. **Recurrent CVT:** Immunosuppression with azathioprine + continued anticoagulation
6. **Refractory ICP:** Neurosurgical evaluation for shunting

**Key Principles:**
- Start azathioprine in ALL parenchymal NBD patients (prevents relapse)
- Cyclosporine monotherapy is CONTRAINDICATED in NBD (worsens neurological disease)
- Anti-TNF agents are the most effective biologics for refractory NBD
- CSF IL-6 guides treatment response monitoring
- Mucocutaneous disease activity predicts neurological relapse risk
- Duration of immunosuppression: typically >=3-5 years; some require lifelong treatment
