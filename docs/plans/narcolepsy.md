**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Narcolepsy Type 1 (NT1):** Central disorder of hypersomnolence with cataplexy and/or CSF hypocretin-1 (orexin-A) ≤110 pg/mL; caused by loss of hypothalamic hypocretin-producing neurons
- **Narcolepsy Type 2 (NT2):** Central disorder of hypersomnolence without cataplexy and with normal or untested CSF hypocretin-1 levels
- **Cataplexy:** Sudden, brief episodes of bilateral skeletal muscle weakness triggered by strong emotions (laughter, surprise, anger) with preserved consciousness
- **Sleep-Onset REM Period (SOREMP):** REM sleep occurring within 15 minutes of sleep onset on PSG or MSLT
- **Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS):** Inability to maintain sustained wakefulness during the day; the hallmark and most disabling symptom of narcolepsy
- **Hypnagogic/Hypnopompic Hallucinations:** Vivid, often frightening, dream-like experiences at sleep onset (hypnagogic) or upon awakening (hypnopompic)
- **Sleep Paralysis:** Inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up, lasting seconds to minutes

---

2. At least one of the following:
    - Cataplexy AND either:
        - Mean sleep latency ≤8 min with ≥2 SOREMPs on MSLT (a SOREMP within 15 min on preceding nocturnal PSG may replace one SOREMP on MSLT)
    - CSF hypocretin-1 concentration ≤110 pg/mL or less than one-third of mean normal values

**Narcolepsy Type 2 — All of the following:**

1. Daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep for ≥3 months

3. No cataplexy
4. CSF hypocretin-1 either not measured or >110 pg/mL
5. Not better explained by another sleep, medical, or psychiatric disorder, or medication/substance use

**Classic Narcolepsy Tetrad (present in ~10-15% of NT1):**

1. Excessive daytime sleepiness (100% of patients)
2. Cataplexy (~70% of NT1; absent in NT2)
3. Sleep paralysis (~25-50%)
4. Hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations (~30-60%)

**Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Severity:**
- Normal: 0-10
- Mild sleepiness: 11-14
- Moderate sleepiness: 15-17
- Severe sleepiness: 18-24

| Report to state DMV as required by local law; obtain fitness-to-drive evaluation through MWT when applicable | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Take scheduled 15-20 minute naps during the day to improve alertness (naps are therapeutic, not a sign of inadequate treatment) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Do not abruptly stop antidepressant medications used for cataplexy as this may cause severe rebound cataplexy (status cataplecticus) | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Notify all providers about narcolepsy diagnosis before any sedation or anesthesia (heightened sensitivity to sedatives) | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid alcohol, which worsens excessive sleepiness and disrupts nocturnal sleep | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

## NOTES

- Narcolepsy type 1 is caused by autoimmune-mediated destruction of hypocretin-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus
- EDS is the most disabling and universal symptom; cataplexy is pathognomonic for NT1 but absent in NT2
- MSLT must be performed after adequate nocturnal sleep (≥6 hours on preceding PSG) and after ≥2 weeks off REM-suppressant medications (antidepressants, tramadol)
- A SOREMP within 15 minutes on the preceding nocturnal PSG can replace one SOREMP on MSLT
- CSF hypocretin-1 testing is the most specific test for NT1 but is not widely available (reference lab only)
- HLA-DQB1*06:02 is present in >90% of NT1 patients but also in ~25% of the general population; it is supportive but not diagnostic
- Sodium oxybate (Xyrem/Xywav) is unique in treating EDS, cataplexy, and disrupted nocturnal sleep simultaneously; requires REMS enrollment
- Xywav (lower-sodium oxybate) contains 92% less sodium than Xyrem; preferred in patients with sodium-sensitive conditions
- Abrupt discontinuation of anticataplectic medications (especially SNRIs, TCAs) can cause severe rebound cataplexy (status cataplecticus)
- Weight gain and obesity are common in NT1 due to hypocretin deficiency affecting metabolism; monitor BMI and metabolic parameters
- Comorbid psychiatric conditions (depression, anxiety) are common and require concurrent treatment
- Narcolepsy onset is typically in adolescence/young adulthood (peak ages 10-25); diagnosis is often delayed 8-15 years from symptom onset
- Pregnancy management: discontinue sodium oxybate and stimulants; scheduled naps are primary treatment; low-dose methylphenidate may be considered with informed consent

## APPENDIX A: MSLT Preparation Protocol

**Prerequisites for Valid MSLT:**

1. **Sleep diary or actigraphy** for ≥2 weeks documenting adequate sleep (≥7 hours/night)
2. **Discontinue REM-suppressant medications** ≥2 weeks prior (≥5 weeks for fluoxetine due to long half-life):
    - SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, escitalopram, citalopram)
    - SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine, desvenlafaxine)
    - TCAs (clomipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline)
    - Tramadol
    - MAOIs
3. **Discontinue stimulants** ≥2 weeks prior (modafinil, methylphenidate, amphetamines)
4. **Urine drug screen** on day of study to confirm medication discontinuation and absence of recreational drugs
5. **Preceding nocturnal PSG** must show:
    - ≥6 hours total sleep time
    - No untreated severe OSA (AHI >30) that could confound results
6. **MSLT protocol:**
    - 5 nap opportunities at 2-hour intervals starting 1.5-3 hours after morning awakening
    - Each nap opportunity lasts 20 minutes; extended to 35 minutes if sleep onset occurs (to evaluate for SOREMP)
    - Record sleep latency and presence of REM sleep for each nap
7. **Positive result:** Mean sleep latency ≤8 minutes with ≥2 SOREMPs

## APPENDIX B: Sodium Oxybate (Xyrem/Xywav) Prescribing Guide

**REMS Program Requirements:**
- Prescriber, pharmacy, and patient must all be enrolled in the REMS program
- Distributed only through central pharmacy (Jazz Pharmaceuticals)
- Patient must sign acknowledgment of risks

**Dosing Protocol:**
1. **Starting dose:** 4.5 g/night divided into 2 equal doses
2. **First dose:** 2.25 g at bedtime (in bed, ready for sleep)
3. **Second dose:** 2.25 g taken 2.5-4 hours later (set alarm)
4. **Titrate:** Increase by 1.5 g/night (0.75 g per dose) every 1-2 weeks
5. **Effective range:** 6-9 g/night
6. **Maximum dose:** 9 g/night

**Critical Safety Instructions:**
- Prepare both doses before bedtime; place second dose at bedside
- Do not take within 2 hours of eating (food delays absorption)
- Do not take with alcohol or other CNS depressants
- Allow ≥6 hours between second dose and any activity requiring alertness
- Store in secure location out of reach of others (abuse potential)
- Monitor for sleepwalking, confusion, respiratory depression
