| Test | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale | Target Finding |
|------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|----------------|
| Antiseizure medication (ASM) levels | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT | **CRITICAL**: Subtherapeutic levels are #1 cause of breakthrough seizures; check ALL ASMs with available assays | Therapeutic ranges (see Appendix); subtherapeutic = adjust dose or assess adherence |
| CBC with differential (CPT 85025) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT | Infection as precipitant; baseline for ASM hematologic effects; thrombocytopenia (valproate) | Normal; leukocytosis → infection workup; low platelets → consider valproate toxicity |
| CMP (BMP + LFTs) (CPT 80053) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT | Electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia common with carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine); renal function (affects ASM dosing); hepatic function (ASM metabolism, toxicity); glucose (hypoglycemia as seizure cause) | Normal; hyponatremia <130 mEq/L can provoke seizures; elevated LFTs → ASM hepatotoxicity |
| Blood glucose (CPT 82947) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT | Hypoglycemia is reversible seizure cause; hyperglycemia (DKA) can also cause seizures | 70-180 mg/dL; hypoglycemia <60 mg/dL → treat immediately |
| Sodium (CPT 84295) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT | Hyponatremia: carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine cause SIADH; <125-130 mEq/L can provoke seizures | 135-145 mEq/L; <130 → correct slowly (risk of osmotic demyelination) |
| Calcium, ionized (CPT 82330) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT | Hypocalcemia can cause seizures; also check if hypocalcemic tetany suspected | Normal ionized Ca; low → replete |
| Magnesium (CPT 83735) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT | Hypomagnesemia lowers seizure threshold; chronic ASM use may deplete Mg | >2.0 mg/dL; low → replete |

## 3. TREATMENT PROTOCOLS

### 3A. Acute/Emergent Treatment

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| **Benzodiazepine (if actively seizing)** (CPT 96374) | IV | Active seizure; first-line for acute seizure termination | 0.1 mg/kg :: IV :: - :: **Lorazepam** 0.1 mg/kg IV (max 4 mg), may repeat x1 in 5 min; **OR Midazolam** 10 mg IM (if no IV access); **OR Diazepam** 0.2 mg/kg IV (max 10 mg); **Intranasal midazolam** 5-10 mg if no IV; **Rectal diazepam** 0.2-0.5 mg/kg (home rescue) | - | First-line for acute seizure termination; lorazepam preferred IV (longer CNS duration); follow status epilepticus protocol if seizure continues >5 min | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| **Protect patient during seizure** | - | Active seizure; injury prevention | N/A :: - :: per protocol :: Clear environment of hazards; DO NOT restrain or put anything in mouth; turn on side (recovery position) when safe; suction secretions; monitor airway; time the seizure | - | Prevent injury; prepare for airway management if prolonged | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| **Post-ictal care** | - | Post-ictal state; airway protection; injury assessment | 92% :: - :: - :: Recovery position; monitor airway (aspiration risk); supplemental O2 if SpO2 <92%; assess for injuries (tongue laceration, shoulder dislocation, vertebral fracture); reassurance; reorientation | - | Post-ictal period is self-limited (typically 5-30 min); prolonged alteration → consider NCSE, repeat seizure, or alternative diagnosis | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| **Administer home ASM (if missed)** | PO/IV | Non-adherence (most common cause of breakthrough seizure) | N/A :: - :: per protocol :: If patient missed doses → give maintenance ASM immediately; if patient does not have medication with them → administer from ED/hospital supply | - | Non-adherence is most common cause of breakthrough seizure; restoring therapeutic levels is priority | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| **Loading dose (if significantly subtherapeutic)** | IV | Significantly subtherapeutic ASM level; need rapid therapeutic concentration | 15-20 mg :: IV :: - :: **Phenytoin/Fosphenytoin:** 15-20 mg PE/kg IV (if level very low); **Valproate:** 20-30 mg/kg IV (if level very low); **Levetiracetam:** 1000-1500 mg IV (if not on levetiracetam — can be added); **Note:** Loading the same drug patient is already taking risks toxicity → use cautiously | - | For significantly subtherapeutic levels or if need rapid therapeutic concentration; adjust for partial levels | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| **Treat precipitant** | - | Identified seizure precipitant (infection, electrolyte, withdrawal) | N/A :: - :: per protocol :: **Infection:** Antibiotics for UTI, pneumonia; **Electrolyte abnormality:** Correct (hyponatremia slowly); **Drug/alcohol withdrawal:** Appropriate protocol; **Sleep deprivation:** Education, sleep hygiene | - | Treating the precipitant may be more important than adjusting ASMs | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |

### 3B. ASM Adjustment Strategies

| Scenario | Treatment | Protocol | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Subtherapeutic level due to non-adherence** | Resume current regimen at prescribed doses | Counsel on importance of adherence; identify barriers (cost, side effects, complexity); pill organizer; simplify regimen if possible | Non-adherence is #1 cause; restoring regimen usually sufficient |
| **Subtherapeutic level at maximum dose** | Increase current ASM OR add second ASM | Increase dose if tolerated and therapeutic range allows; OR add complementary ASM (e.g., add levetiracetam to lamotrigine) | Some patients require levels above "therapeutic range" for control |
| **Therapeutic level but breakthrough seizure** | Add second ASM OR optimize current ASM timing | Consider drug-drug interaction reducing efficacy; add ASM with different mechanism; divide doses more frequently for better coverage | Breakthrough at therapeutic levels may require adjunctive therapy |
| **Subtherapeutic due to drug interaction** | Remove interacting drug OR increase ASM dose OR switch ASM | Example: Starting enzyme inducer (rifampin, carbamazepine) reduces lamotrigine level by 50% → double lamotrigine dose | Enzyme inducers and inhibitors significantly affect ASM levels |
| **Pregnancy with subtherapeutic level** | Increase dose with frequent monitoring | Pregnancy increases clearance (especially lamotrigine, levetiracetam); monitor levels monthly; anticipate need for increased doses | Seizure risk to mother and fetus outweighs small ASM risk; maintain control |
| **New-onset breakthrough in previously controlled epilepsy** | Full re-evaluation | Imaging (new structural lesion?); EEG; consider progressive cause (tumor, autoimmune); assess for PNES | Change in control pattern requires investigation for new etiology |

### 3C. Specific ASM Adjustments

| ASM | Therapeutic Range | Adjustment Notes |
|-----|------------------|------------------|
| **Phenytoin** | Total: 10-20 mcg/mL; Free: 1-2 mcg/mL | Nonlinear kinetics; small dose changes → large level changes; check free level if hypoalbuminemia, renal failure, pregnancy; adjust dose by 25-50 mg increments |
| **Carbamazepine** | 4-12 mcg/mL | Auto-induction over 2-4 weeks (levels drop); check 4 weeks after initiation; also check epoxide level if toxicity suspected |
| **Valproate** | Total: 50-100 mcg/mL; Free: 5-15 mcg/mL | Highly protein-bound; check free level in elderly, hepatic disease, pregnancy; check ammonia if encephalopathy |
| **Levetiracetam** | Not routinely monitored (no established range) | Level: 12-46 mcg/mL often cited; renal dosing required; generally well-tolerated dose increases |
| **Lamotrigine** | 3-14 mcg/mL (varies) | Highly affected by enzyme inducers (carbamazepine, phenytoin, oral contraceptives) and inhibitors (valproate); pregnancy increases clearance; slow titration to avoid rash |
| **Oxcarbazepine** | 10,11-monohydroxy derivative: 3-35 mcg/mL | Causes hyponatremia (check sodium); less drug interactions than carbamazepine |
| **Lacosamide** | 10-20 mcg/mL (emerging data) | Check ECG (PR prolongation); dose-dependent side effects; no major drug interactions |
| **Topiramate** | 5-20 mcg/mL (not well-established) | Renal dosing; causes metabolic acidosis, cognitive effects, kidney stones; enzyme inducer reduces OCP efficacy |
| **Phenobarbital** | 15-40 mcg/mL | Long half-life (adjust weekly); sedation; enzyme inducer |
| **Brivaracetam** | Not routinely monitored | Similar to levetiracetam but may have fewer behavioral side effects; can substitute directly for levetiracetam |
| **Clobazam** | 0.03-0.3 mcg/mL (+ N-desmethylclobazam metabolite) | Benzodiazepine; tolerance may develop; useful adjunct especially in Lennox-Gastaut |

### 3D. Non-Pharmacologic Considerations

| Intervention | Setting | Details |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Seizure precautions** | HOSP/ICU | Padded side rails; suction at bedside; no sharps within reach; fall risk protocol; 1:1 supervision if frequent seizures |
| **Driving restrictions** | OPD/Discharge | State-specific laws; generally 3-12 months seizure-free required; document counseling; patient should NOT drive until cleared |
| **Activity restrictions** | OPD/Discharge | Avoid swimming alone; no heights (ladders, scaffolding); avoid dangerous machinery; bathing vs. showers (supervision if frequent seizures) |
| **Sleep hygiene** | OPD/Discharge | Sleep deprivation is major trigger; regular sleep schedule; 7-8 hours nightly; avoid shift work if possible |
| **Alcohol / substance avoidance** | OPD/Discharge | Alcohol lowers seizure threshold; withdrawal is high risk; cocaine/amphetamines provoke seizures; counsel strongly |
| **Stress management** | OPD/Discharge | Stress/anxiety are common triggers; counseling; mindfulness; adequate support |
| **VNS (vagus nerve stimulator) check** | OPD | If patient has VNS → check device function; consider adjusting parameters; use magnet during seizure if trained |
| **Ketogenic diet (if on)** | OPD | Ensure compliance; check ketosis; dietary counseling |
| **Epilepsy surgery evaluation** | OPD | If drug-resistant epilepsy (failure of 2 appropriate ASMs at adequate doses) → refer for surgical evaluation |

| **Movement disorders** | Dystonia; chorea; myoclonus (non-epileptic); paroxysmal dyskinesia | Preserved awareness; stereotyped movements; neurologic exam; movement disorder evaluation |
| **Migraine with aura** | Visual, sensory, or motor aura preceding headache; duration 20-60 min; no LOC | Headache history; migraine features; may have EEG abnormalities but distinct from seizure |

### Common Precipitants of Breakthrough Seizures

| Precipitant | Mechanism | Evaluation/Intervention |
|-------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Non-adherence / missed doses** | Subtherapeutic ASM levels | Ask directly; check levels; pharmacy refill records; address barriers |
| **Sleep deprivation** | Lowers seizure threshold significantly | Sleep hygiene counseling; regular schedule; treat sleep disorders |
| **Infection (especially UTI)** | Fever lowers seizure threshold; metabolic stress | UA/culture; CXR; treat infection |
| **Alcohol use / withdrawal** | Both intoxication and withdrawal provoke seizures | Alcohol level; history; withdrawal prophylaxis |
| **Medication changes** | Drug interactions; started medication that lowers threshold | Medication reconciliation; check levels; review interactions |
| **Stress / anxiety** | Hyperexcitability | Stress management; counseling; anxiolytics if appropriate |
| **Menstrual cycle (catamenial epilepsy)** | Perimenstrual or periovulatory clustering | Seizure diary correlation; hormonal treatment; increase ASM perimenstrually |
| **Electrolyte abnormalities** | Hyponatremia (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine); hypocalcemia; hypomagnesemia | Electrolyte panel; correct abnormality |
| **Illicit drugs** | Cocaine, amphetamines lower seizure threshold | Drug screen; counseling |
| **Flashing lights / photosensitivity** | Photic stimulation triggers seizures in photosensitive epilepsy | EEG with photic stimulation; avoid triggers; blue-tinted lenses |

### Red Flags Suggesting Alternative Diagnosis

| Red Flag | Concern | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| New focal neurologic deficit | New structural lesion (tumor, stroke, hemorrhage) | STAT imaging (CT then MRI) |
| Prolonged post-ictal state (>30 min) | Status epilepticus; NCSE; structural lesion; metabolic cause; postictal paralysis (Todd's) | Continuous EEG; imaging; extended metabolic workup |
| Fever with seizure | Meningitis/encephalitis; febrile seizure in adult is concerning | LP if meningitis suspected; imaging; antibiotics/antivirals empirically if indicated |
| Change in seizure semiology | New epileptogenic lesion; different seizure type; PNES | EEG; MRI; video-EEG if needed |
| No return to baseline | Ongoing NCSE; structural lesion; metabolic encephalopathy | Continuous EEG; imaging; metabolic workup |
| First seizure at this facility | May not be known epilepsy; needs full new-onset seizure workup | Full workup unless confirmed prior epilepsy |
| Eyes closed during "seizure" | PNES (epileptic seizures typically have eyes open) | Video-EEG; psychology referral |
| Very prolonged event (>5-10 min) | Status epilepticus; PNES (epileptic seizures typically <2-3 min) | Treat as SE if epileptic; video-EEG for characterization |

| Epilepsy & Pregnancy | AAN/AES/SMFM | 2024 | Folic acid 0.4-4 mg daily for all women of childbearing potential; avoid valproate in pregnancy if possible; lamotrigine and levetiracetam generally preferred ([Pack et al. Neurology 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38748979/)) |
| SUDEP Prevention | AAN | 2017 | Counsel on sudden unexpected death in epilepsy; nocturnal supervision reduces risk; seizure control reduces risk |

### Landmark Studies

| Study | Finding | Impact |
|-------|---------|--------|
| [Kwan & Brodie (2000)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10660394/) | 47% of newly diagnosed epilepsy patients became seizure-free on first ASM; 13% on second; 4% on third; after failure of 2 appropriate ASMs, chance of seizure freedom with additional ASMs is <5% | Defined drug-resistant epilepsy; established rationale for early surgery referral |
| SANAD I & II (2007, 2021) | Lamotrigine best for focal epilepsy; valproate best for generalized/unclassified (but teratogenic); levetiracetam non-inferior to lamotrigine for focal | Guide first-line ASM selection by seizure type |
| Standard and New Antiepileptic Drugs (SNAED) Trial | Levetiracetam and zonisamide non-inferior to lamotrigine for focal epilepsy | Expanded first-line options |
| [Early Randomized Surgical Epilepsy Trial (ERSET, 2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22396514/) | Early surgery superior to continued medical therapy for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy; 73% vs. 0% seizure-free at 2 years | Surgery is highly effective; early referral improves outcomes |

```

### Appendix B: Common Drug Interactions Affecting ASM Levels

| Interacting Drug | Effect on ASM | Affected ASMs | Action |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| **Enzyme Inducers** (rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's Wort) | ↓ ASM levels | Lamotrigine (↓50%), valproate, topiramate, levetiracetam (mild), clobazam, perampanel | Increase ASM dose; monitor levels |
| **Enzyme Inhibitors** (valproate, fluoxetine, erythromycin) | ↑ ASM levels | Lamotrigine (valproate doubles level), carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin | Decrease ASM dose; lamotrigine titration much slower when adding to valproate |
| **Oral Contraceptives** (estrogen) | ↓ Lamotrigine levels | Lamotrigine (↓50%) | Increase lamotrigine dose; may need to decrease during pill-free week |
| **Carbapenems** (imipenem, meropenem) | ↓ Valproate levels dramatically | Valproate (↓60-90%) | Avoid combination if possible; if used, significantly increase valproate or use alternative ASM |
| **Antacids** | ↓ Absorption of some ASMs | Gabapentin, phenytoin | Separate administration by 2 hours |
| **Protein-binding displacement** | ↑ Free ASM fraction | Phenytoin, valproate (with aspirin, warfarin, other highly bound drugs) | Check free levels |

### Appendix C: ASM Selection by Seizure Type

| Seizure Type | First-Line Options | Avoid |
|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Focal (aware or impaired awareness)** | Lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine | Ethosuximide (not effective) |
| **Focal to bilateral tonic-clonic** | Same as focal | Same as focal |
| **Generalized tonic-clonic** | Valproate (if not woman of childbearing potential), lamotrigine, levetiracetam | Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin (may worsen) |
| **Absence (typical)** | Ethosuximide (first-line for absence only), valproate, lamotrigine | Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin (can worsen) |
| **Myoclonic** | Valproate, levetiracetam, clonazepam | Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, gabapentin (can worsen) |
| **Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME)** | Valproate (most effective but avoid in women), lamotrigine (may worsen myoclonus), levetiracetam | Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin |
| **Lennox-Gastaut syndrome** | Lamotrigine, valproate, clobazam, rufinamide, felbamate, cannabidiol | N/A (polytherapy usually required) |
| **Dravet syndrome (SCN1A)** | Valproate, clobazam, stiripentol, cannabidiol, fenfluramine | **AVOID sodium channel blockers** (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine) — can worsen seizures |

### Appendix D: Special Populations

| Population | Considerations |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Pregnancy** | Folic acid 0.4-4 mg daily (start preconception); avoid valproate if possible (highest teratogenicity); lamotrigine and levetiracetam generally preferred; levels drop in pregnancy (especially lamotrigine) — monitor monthly and increase doses; valproate level may be falsely reassuring (protein binding changes) |
| **Women of childbearing potential** | Counsel all on teratogenicity; contraception counseling (enzyme inducers reduce OCP efficacy); preconception planning; folic acid; prefer lamotrigine, levetiracetam over valproate |
| **Elderly** | Increased sensitivity to ASM side effects; cognitive effects; falls; start low, go slow; drug interactions (polypharmacy); lamotrigine, levetiracetam, lacosamide generally well-tolerated; avoid phenobarbital, high-dose phenytoin |
| **Renal impairment** | Reduce doses of renally-cleared ASMs: levetiracetam, gabapentin, pregabalin, topiramate, lacosamide; phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate less affected |
| **Hepatic impairment** | Reduce doses of hepatically-metabolized ASMs: phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate, lamotrigine; levetiracetam, gabapentin safer |
| **Cardiac disease** | Avoid lacosamide if significant AV block (PR prolongation); carbamazepine has cardiac conduction effects; check ECG |
| **Psychiatric comorbidity** | Depression common in epilepsy; levetiracetam can cause behavioral side effects (irritability, aggression) — consider brivaracetam instead; valproate may worsen depression; lamotrigine has mood-stabilizing properties |
