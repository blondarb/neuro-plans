| Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) | History of repetitive head trauma; mood and behavioral changes; no diagnostic test in life | History; clinical pattern; cavum septum pellucidum on MRI (suggestive) |
| CADASIL | Migraine with aura; early WM disease; family history; temporal pole and external capsule involvement | NOTCH3 genetic testing; skin biopsy showing GOM deposits |
| CNS vasculitis | Younger age; headache; encephalopathy; multifocal strokes; elevated inflammatory markers | Vessel wall MRI; DSA; brain/leptomeningeal biopsy |
| Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease | Rapid progression (weeks-months); myoclonus; periodic sharp waves on EEG; MRI DWI ribboning | CSF RT-QuIC; 14-3-3; EEG |
| Delirium superimposed on dementia | Acute change; fluctuating attention; identifiable precipitant (infection, medication, metabolic) | Treat cause; reassess cognition when clear |

## APPENDIX A: NINDS-AIREN Diagnostic Criteria for Vascular Dementia

### Probable Vascular Dementia (All Required)

1. **Dementia** defined by cognitive decline from a previously higher level, manifested by:
   - Memory impairment AND
   - Impairment in two or more cognitive domains (orientation, attention, language, visuospatial, executive, motor control, praxis)
   - Deficits severe enough to interfere with ADLs
   - Not due to physical effects of stroke alone

2. **Cerebrovascular disease** defined by:
   - Focal neurological signs consistent with stroke (hemiparesis, facial weakness, Babinski sign, sensory deficit, hemianopia, dysarthria) AND
   - Evidence of relevant CVD on neuroimaging (CT or MRI) including:
     - Multiple large-vessel infarcts
     - Single strategically placed infarct (angular gyrus, thalamus, basal forebrain, PCA or ACA territory)
     - Multiple basal ganglia and white matter lacunes
     - Extensive periventricular white matter lesions
     - Combinations of the above

3. **Relationship between dementia and CVD** inferred by:
   - Onset of dementia within 3 months of recognized stroke OR
   - Abrupt deterioration in cognitive functions OR
   - Fluctuating, stepwise progression of cognitive deficits

### Features Consistent with Diagnosis

- Early gait disturbance
- History of unsteadiness and frequent falls
- Early urinary frequency, urgency, and incontinence not explained by urological disease
- Pseudobulbar palsy
- Personality and mood changes (abulia, depression, emotional incontinence)
- Preserved insight and judgment until late stages

### Features Making Diagnosis Uncertain

- Early memory impairment with progressive worsening without imaging changes
- Absence of focal neurological signs
- Absence of CVD lesions on imaging

---

## APPENDIX B: Neuroimaging Findings in Vascular Dementia

### Strategic Infarct Locations

| Location | Clinical Manifestation |
|----------|----------------------|
| Thalamus (bilateral) | Severe amnesia, apathy, executive dysfunction |
| Angular gyrus (dominant) | Alexia, agraphia, anomia, Gerstmann syndrome |
| Anterior cerebral artery | Abulia, apathy, executive dysfunction |
| Posterior cerebral artery | Visual agnosia, amnesia (hippocampal involvement) |
| Basal ganglia (caudate) | Executive dysfunction, behavioral changes |
| Hippocampus | Anterograde amnesia |

### White Matter Disease Grading (Fazekas Scale)

| Grade | Description | Clinical Implication |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| 0 | Absent | Normal |
| 1 | Punctate foci | Mild; may be age-related |
| 2 | Beginning confluence of foci | Moderate; clinically significant |
| 3 | Large confluent areas | Severe; strongly associated with VaD |

### Microbleed Distribution

| Pattern | Associated Condition |
|---------|---------------------|
| Lobar (cortical-subcortical) | Cerebral amyloid angiopathy |
| Deep (basal ganglia, thalamus) | Hypertensive microangiopathy |
| Mixed | Both pathologies may coexist |

---

## APPENDIX C: Differentiating Vascular Dementia from Alzheimer's Disease

| Feature | Vascular Dementia | Alzheimer's Disease |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| Onset | Abrupt or stepwise | Insidious, gradual |
| Progression | Stepwise or fluctuating | Gradual, continuous |
| Memory | Variable; may be preserved early | Prominent early memory loss |
| Executive function | Prominently impaired | Impaired later |
| Focal neurological signs | Often present | Usually absent |
| Gait disturbance | Early and prominent | Late feature |
| Incontinence | Early | Late |
| MRI findings | Strategic infarcts, WM disease, lacunes | Hippocampal/MTL atrophy |
| Amyloid PET | Negative (or positive if mixed) | Positive |
| CSF Aβ42 | Normal | Low |
| CSF p-tau | Normal or mildly elevated | Elevated |
| Response to ChEIs | Modest | More robust |
| Vascular risk factors | Prominent | May be present |

**Note:** Mixed dementia (AD + VaD) is common, especially in elderly patients. Look for features of both pathologies.
