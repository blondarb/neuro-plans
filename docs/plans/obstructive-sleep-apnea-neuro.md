# Obstructive Sleep Apnea — Neurological Evaluation

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** February 7, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Obstructive Sleep Apnea — Neurological Evaluation

**ICD-10:** G47.33 (Obstructive sleep apnea)

**CPT CODES:** 95810 (Polysomnography (PSG)), 95800 (Home sleep apnea test (HSAT)), 85025 (CBC), 80053 (CMP), 84443 (TSH), 83036 (HbA1c), 80061 (Lipid panel), 70553 (MRI brain with and without contrast), 96132 (Neurocognitive testing)

**SYNONYMS:** OSA, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, sleep-disordered breathing, upper airway resistance syndrome, OSAS, sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome

**SCOPE:** Neurological evaluation and management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults. Focuses on neurology-specific aspects: stroke risk assessment, cognitive impact, epilepsy interaction, headache relationship, and neuropathy/autonomic effects. Excludes primary pulmonary/ENT management, central sleep apnea (separate entity), and pediatric OSA. Complements pulmonology/sleep medicine primary management.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA):** Repetitive partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep causing intermittent hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and sleep fragmentation; associated with significant neurological morbidity including stroke, cognitive decline, and seizure exacerbation
- **Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI):** Number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep; mild 5-14, moderate 15-29, severe ≥30
- **Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS):** Inability to maintain sustained wakefulness during the day; common neurological symptom of untreated OSA affecting cognitive performance and driving safety
- **Intermittent Hypoxia:** Cyclic oxygen desaturation and reoxygenation during obstructive events; principal mechanism of OSA-related neurological injury through oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction
- **Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI):** Number of oxygen desaturation events (≥3% or ≥4% drop) per hour of sleep; correlates with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk
- **CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure):** First-line treatment maintaining airway patency via positive pressure; demonstrated neuroprotective benefit including stroke risk reduction, cognitive improvement, and seizure frequency reduction
- **STOP-BANG Score:** Validated screening questionnaire (Snoring, Tiredness, Observed apneas, Pressure, BMI >35, Age >50, Neck >40 cm, Gender male); score ≥3 indicates high risk for OSA

---

**DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA:**

**OSA Diagnosis (ICSD-3/AASM):**

1. **OSA with symptoms:** AHI ≥5 events/hour on PSG or HSAT AND at least one of:
    - Excessive daytime sleepiness not explained by other factors
    - Observed habitual snoring, breathing interruptions, or gasping/choking during sleep
    - Witnessed apneas
    - Diagnosed hypertension, mood disorder, cognitive dysfunction, coronary artery disease, stroke, CHF, atrial fibrillation, or type 2 diabetes mellitus
2. **OSA without symptoms:** AHI ≥15 events/hour on PSG or HSAT regardless of symptoms

**Severity Classification:**
- Mild: AHI 5-14 events/hour
- Moderate: AHI 15-29 events/hour
- Severe: AHI ≥30 events/hour

**Neurological Risk Stratification:**
- Moderate-severe OSA (AHI ≥15) associated with 2-3 fold increased stroke risk
- Nocturnal hypoxemia (SpO2 nadir <80%) associated with white matter disease and cognitive decline
- OSA with atrial fibrillation: compound stroke risk requiring aggressive management
- Comorbid epilepsy: untreated OSA increases seizure frequency by up to 2-fold

**Screening Tools:**
- **Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS):** 0-10 normal; 11-14 mild; 15-17 moderate; 18-24 severe sleepiness
- **STOP-BANG Questionnaire:** 0-2 low risk; 3-4 intermediate risk; 5-8 high risk for moderate-severe OSA

| Bariatric surgery evaluation for patients with BMI ≥35 with OSA-related comorbidities or BMI ≥40; weight loss surgery produces sustained AHI reduction and may cure OSA | - | - | EXT | - |

### 4B. Patient/Family Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| OSA is a chronic neurological risk factor that significantly increases stroke risk (2-3 fold) and causes progressive cognitive decline if untreated; CPAP treatment reduces stroke risk by 40-60% | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Use CPAP every night for the entire sleep period; minimum 4 hours/night required for cardiovascular benefit; optimal benefit at ≥6 hours/night; even partial use is better than no use | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Report new neurological symptoms immediately: sudden weakness, speech difficulty, vision changes, severe headache, numbness, or new seizures (may indicate stroke or neurological complication of OSA) | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Do not drive if excessively sleepy; untreated OSA increases motor vehicle accident risk 2-7 fold; resume driving only after EDS is controlled with CPAP (ESS <11) | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid alcohol within 3 hours of bedtime; alcohol relaxes upper airway muscles, worsens apneas, and increases nocturnal hypoxemia independently of body position | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid sedating medications (benzodiazepines, opioids, sedating antihistamines, muscle relaxants) unless prescribed by a physician aware of OSA diagnosis; these worsen respiratory depression during sleep | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Bed partner observations are valuable; report witnessed apneas, gasping, choking, or unusual movements during sleep at each visit | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Weight management: 10% body weight loss produces approximately 26% AHI reduction; even modest weight loss (5-7%) improves oxygen desaturation and reduces cardiovascular risk | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Regular aerobic exercise: 150 minutes/week moderate-intensity exercise reduces AHI by 25% independent of weight loss; improves endothelial function and reduces inflammatory markers | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Sleep position training: avoid supine sleeping; lateral and prone positions reduce AHI by 50% or more in position-dependent OSA; elevate head of bed 30 degrees | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Smoking cessation: smoking increases upper airway inflammation, edema, and OSA severity; smoking is an independent stroke risk factor compounding OSA risk | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Limit caffeine to morning hours only to preserve sleep architecture; avoid caffeine after noon; caffeine does not substitute for CPAP therapy | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Nasal congestion management with nasal saline rinse and intranasal corticosteroid to improve CPAP tolerance and reduce oral breathing | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

## NOTES

- OSA is the most common sleep-disordered breathing condition and a major modifiable neurological risk factor; prevalence is 10-17% in adult men and 3-9% in adult women
- The neurological consequences of OSA are driven primarily by intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation, which cause oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and sympathetic hyperactivation
- Stroke risk in moderate-severe OSA is increased 2-3 fold independently of other vascular risk factors; this risk is substantially reduced with CPAP adherence
- OSA-related cognitive impairment affects attention, executive function, visuospatial processing, and memory; deficits in attention and executive function are most reversible with CPAP treatment, while memory deficits may persist
- Morning headache is present in up to 30% of OSA patients, often mimicking tension-type headache or chronic daily headache; resolves with effective CPAP therapy in most cases
- OSA lowers seizure threshold through sleep fragmentation and hypoxemia; CPAP treatment reduces seizure frequency by up to 50% in comorbid epilepsy patients; optimize OSA treatment before escalating AEDs
- Avoid sedating AEDs (phenobarbital, benzodiazepines, pregabalin) in epilepsy patients with OSA; prefer weight-neutral, non-sedating agents (levetiracetam, lamotrigine, lacosamide)
- OSA is the leading identifiable cause of resistant hypertension; always screen hypertensive patients for OSA, especially if requiring ≥3 antihypertensive agents
- CPAP compliance is the critical determinant of neurological benefit; minimum 4 hours/night required for cardiovascular benefit; optimal benefit at ≥6 hours/night
- Atrial fibrillation prevalence is 4-5 fold higher in severe OSA; OSA-related AF has higher recurrence after cardioversion without CPAP; optimize OSA treatment before and after AF ablation
- Weight management is a powerful adjunct: 10% weight loss reduces AHI by approximately 26% and may eliminate mild OSA
- Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) may coexist with severe OSA; suspect if awake hypercapnia (PaCO2 >45 mmHg) or serum bicarbonate >27 mEq/L; OHS requires bilevel PAP rather than CPAP alone
- Autonomic dysfunction in OSA manifests as sympathetic hyperactivation, reduced heart rate variability, and impaired baroreceptor sensitivity; contributes to hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death risk
- REM-predominant OSA (apneas predominantly in REM sleep) is more common in women and may be underestimated by overall AHI; associated with greater cardiovascular risk per event
