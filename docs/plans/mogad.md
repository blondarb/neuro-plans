# MOG Antibody Disease (MOGAD)

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** January 30, 2026
**REVISED:** January 30, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** MOG Antibody Disease (MOGAD)

**ICD-10:** G36.9 (Acute disseminated demyelination, unspecified), G36.0 (Neuromyelitis optica)

**SYNONYMS:** MOG antibody disease, MOGAD, MOG-IgG associated disorder, MOG antibody-associated demyelination, anti-MOG disease, MOG spectrum disorder, MOG-associated optic neuritis, MOG-associated transverse myelitis, MOG-ADEM, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis, acute treatment, relapse prevention, and long-term monitoring of MOG antibody disease (MOGAD). Covers MOG-IgG testing and interpretation, clinical phenotypes (optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, ADEM-like presentations, brainstem/cerebellar syndromes), differentiation from MS and NMOSD (AQP4), acute attack treatment (IV methylprednisolone, IVIG, PLEX), slow oral steroid taper, maintenance immunotherapy (IVIG, azathioprine, mycophenolate, rituximab), monophasic vs relapsing disease course, and serial MOG-IgG titer monitoring. Excludes AQP4-positive NMOSD (use "NMOSD" template) and MS (use "MS - New Diagnosis" template).

*Note: MOG-IgG testing MUST use cell-based assay (CBA) -- live CBA has highest sensitivity and specificity. ELISA-based MOG testing has unacceptable false-positive rates and should NOT be used for diagnosis. Serum is the primary specimen for MOG-IgG; CSF MOG-IgG testing is not routinely recommended. ALWAYS co-test AQP4-IgG to differentiate from NMOSD. Results may take 1-3 weeks; do NOT delay empiric treatment if clinical suspicion is high.*

*Note: IVIG maintenance has the strongest evidence base for relapse prevention in MOGAD. Rituximab may be LESS effective in MOGAD compared to AQP4-NMOSD because MOG-IgG is produced primarily by short-lived plasmablasts rather than long-lived plasma cells. Treatment decisions (monophasic vs relapsing) should be guided by: (1) number of attacks, (2) severity of attacks, (3) persistent MOG-IgG seropositivity (seropositive patients more likely to relapse), (4) residual disability. First attack with seroconversion to negative may be observed without maintenance therapy. Multiple relapses or persistent seropositivity warrants maintenance immunotherapy.*

| Return to ED immediately for new or worsening vision loss, new weakness, numbness, or bladder/bowel dysfunction (may indicate new attack or relapse) | Y | Y | Y | - |

## CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT NOTES

### MOGAD Diagnostic Criteria (2023 International Panel)

Required:
- [ ] At least one core clinical event (optic neuritis, myelitis, ADEM, cerebral monofocal or polyfocal deficits, brainstem/cerebellar presentation, cerebral cortical encephalitis)
- [ ] MOG-IgG seropositivity by cell-based assay (CBA)
- [ ] Exclusion of better diagnoses

Supporting features:
- [ ] Bilateral optic neuritis (simultaneous or sequential)
- [ ] Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM >=3 segments)
- [ ] Conus medullaris involvement
- [ ] Perineural optic nerve enhancement on MRI
- [ ] CSF oligoclonal bands ABSENT
- [ ] Typical MRI brain pattern (ill-defined T2/FLAIR lesions, deep gray matter involvement)

### Key Differentiating Features: MOGAD vs MS vs AQP4-NMOSD

| Feature | MOGAD | MS | AQP4-NMOSD |
|---------|-------|----|----|
| Antibody | MOG-IgG+ | Negative | AQP4-IgG+ |
| Sex predominance | Equal M:F or slight F | F > M (3:1) | F >> M (9:1) |
| Age at onset | Any age; bimodal (children + adults) | 20-40 years | 30-50 years |
| Ethnicity | All ethnicities | Northern European | Non-white predominance |
| OCBs in CSF | Usually negative | >95% positive | Usually negative |
| Optic neuritis | Bilateral; anterior; perineural enhancement; papillitis | Retrobulbar; unilateral; short segment | Posterior/chiasmal; severe; poor recovery |
| Myelitis | LETM (>=3); conus; central | Short segment (<3); dorsal | LETM (>=3); central; bright spotty |
| Brain MRI | Fluffy/ill-defined; ADEM-like; deep gray matter | Dawson fingers; periventricular; juxtacortical | Area postrema; periependymal; diencephalic |
| Recovery | Typically good | Variable | Often poor (especially ON) |
| Course | 40-80% relapsing; some monophasic | Almost always relapsing; progressive forms | Almost always relapsing |
| Steroid response | Excellent but relapses on taper | Moderate | Good |

### Red Flags Suggesting MOGAD Over MS

- [ ] Bilateral simultaneous optic neuritis
- [ ] Optic disc edema (papillitis) -- MS is typically retrobulbar
- [ ] Perineural optic nerve enhancement on MRI
- [ ] LETM (>=3 segments) -- MS is typically short segment
- [ ] Conus medullaris involvement
- [ ] CSF oligoclonal bands ABSENT with demyelinating presentation
- [ ] Relapse during steroid taper (especially below 20 mg prednisone)
- [ ] ADEM-like presentation (especially in children)
- [ ] MRI brain lesions that are fluffy/ill-defined without Dawson fingers
- [ ] Excellent recovery from attacks (better than expected for MS/AQP4)
