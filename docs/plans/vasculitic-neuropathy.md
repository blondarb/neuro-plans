# Vasculitic Neuropathy

**VERSION:** 1.2
**CREATED:** February 11, 2026
**REVISED:** February 11, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Vasculitic Neuropathy

**ICD-10:** G63 (Polyneuropathy in diseases classified elsewhere), M31.7 (Microscopic polyangiitis), M30.0 (Polyarteritis nodosa), M31.30 (Wegener granulomatosis without renal involvement — GPA), M31.31 (Wegener granulomatosis with renal involvement — GPA), M30.1 (Polyarteritis with lung involvement — EGPA), M35.2 (Behçet disease)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC), 80053 (CMP), 86200 (CRP), 85652 (ESR), 86235 (ANA), 86038 (Anti-dsDNA), 86021 (ANCA screen), 86022 (MPO/PR3 antibodies), 83883 (Complement C3), 83885 (Complement C4), 86157 (Cryoglobulins), 86803 (Hepatitis C antibody), 87340 (Hepatitis B surface antigen), 86592 (RPR), 82784 (Immunoglobulins quantitative), 82785 (Rheumatoid factor), 81001 (Urinalysis with microscopy), 95907-95913 (NCS), 95860-95870 (EMG), 88305 (Nerve/muscle biopsy pathology), 70553 (MRI brain), 71260 (CT chest with contrast), 74178 (CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast)

**SYNONYMS:** vasculitic neuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, vasculitis of peripheral nerves, non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy, NSVN, peripheral nerve vasculitis, necrotizing vasculitis with neuropathy, polyarteritis nodosa neuropathy, ANCA-associated vasculitis neuropathy, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis neuropathy, EGPA neuropathy

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of peripheral neuropathy caused by vasculitis of the vasa nervorum. Covers systemic vasculitis (PAN, GPA, MPA, EGPA, cryoglobulinemic), non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN), and connective tissue disease-associated (RA, SLE, Sjögren). Includes diagnostic workup, nerve/muscle biopsy guidance, immunosuppressive treatment, and pain management. Excludes CNS vasculitis (covered separately).

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Mononeuritis multiplex:** Simultaneous or sequential involvement of two or more non-contiguous peripheral nerves; hallmark pattern of vasculitic neuropathy
- **Non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN):** Vasculitis confined to peripheral nerves without evidence of systemic organ involvement; accounts for ~30-50% of vasculitic neuropathy cases
- **ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV):** Small-vessel vasculitides including GPA (PR3-ANCA), MPA (MPO-ANCA), and EGPA (MPO-ANCA or ANCA-negative)
- **Vasa nervorum:** Small arteries and arterioles supplying peripheral nerves; target of vasculitic inflammation leading to ischemic nerve damage
- **Necrotizing vasculitis:** Fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls with inflammatory infiltrate; pathologic hallmark on nerve biopsy

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Disposition | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Discharge from ED | Stable neuropathy without acute progression; outpatient rheumatology and neurology follow-up arranged; no systemic organ involvement requiring urgent intervention |
| Admit to floor | Rapidly progressive neuropathy with new weakness; suspected systemic vasculitis with organ involvement (renal, pulmonary); need for IV pulse steroids or cyclophosphamide; nerve biopsy planning |
| Admit to ICU | Pulmonary hemorrhage; rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with dialysis need; severe multiorgan vasculitis; respiratory failure from neuromuscular weakness |
| Outpatient follow-up (rheumatology) | All patients: q2-4 weeks during induction; q1-3 months during maintenance; immunosuppression monitoring and taper guidance |
| Outpatient follow-up (neurology) | All patients: q3-6 months for NCS/EMG monitoring, pain management, and functional assessment |

## NOTES

- Mononeuritis multiplex is the hallmark but not universal; ~30% present with distal symmetric polyneuropathy pattern
- Nerve biopsy yield is highest with combined sural nerve + gastrocnemius muscle biopsy; sensitivity ~80% with combined approach
- NSVN (non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy) is diagnosed when vasculitis is confined to peripheral nerves without systemic organ involvement; often requires less aggressive immunosuppression (steroids ± azathioprine vs cyclophosphamide)
- Always check ANCA, hepatitis B/C, complement, and cryoglobulins before assuming "idiopathic" vasculitic neuropathy
- PAN is strongly associated with hepatitis B; antiviral therapy is first-line for HBV-associated PAN
- EGPA should be suspected when eosinophilia >1500/μL accompanies neuropathy and asthma
- Axonal damage from vasculitic nerve infarction may be irreversible; early aggressive immunosuppression is critical to prevent further nerve damage
- Pain management is essential; neuropathic pain is often severe and requires multimodal therapy
- Cyclophosphamide cumulative dose should not exceed 25 g (increased malignancy risk); switch to maintenance agent after 3-6 months of induction
- Rituximab is increasingly preferred over cyclophosphamide for AAV, especially in patients of childbearing potential or with relapsing disease
