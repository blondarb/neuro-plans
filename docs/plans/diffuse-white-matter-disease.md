# Diffuse White Matter Disease

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** February 11, 2026
**REVISED:** February 11, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Diffuse White Matter Disease

**ICD-10:** R53.1 (Weakness); G93.49 (Other encephalopathy, not elsewhere classified); G31.9 (Degenerative disease of nervous system, unspecified)

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of diffuse white matter changes found on neuroimaging, including systematic differential diagnosis approach (vascular, inflammatory, infectious, metabolic, genetic, toxic), workup prioritization by clinical context, and management across care settings. Excludes focal single-lesion pathology and acute stroke as primary diagnosis but includes in differential. Covers both incidental findings and symptomatic presentations.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **White matter disease (WMD):** Abnormal signal in cerebral white matter on MRI (T2/FLAIR hyperintensity) or hypodensity on CT; reflects damage to myelin, axons, or supporting glial cells from any etiology
- **Leukoaraiosis:** Diffuse periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities associated with cerebral small vessel disease and aging; Fazekas scale grades severity (0-3)
- **Leukoencephalopathy:** Broad term for white matter disorders; may be acquired (vascular, inflammatory, toxic, infectious) or genetic (leukodystrophies)
- **Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD):** Umbrella term for pathological processes affecting small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries; the most common cause of diffuse white matter changes in adults
- **Leukodystrophy:** Inherited disorders of myelin formation or maintenance; typically progressive; adult-onset forms increasingly recognized

## NOTES

- Diffuse white matter disease is a radiological finding, not a diagnosis; the critical first step is determining the underlying etiology
- The most common cause in adults over 50 is cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) related to hypertension, diabetes, and aging
- Young patients (<50) without vascular risk factors require aggressive workup for inflammatory, infectious, metabolic, and genetic etiologies
- MRI pattern recognition is essential: periventricular (CSVD, MS), subcortical U-fibers (PML, ADEM), posterior predominant (ALD, PRES, toxic), anterior temporal pole (CADASIL), corpus callosum (MS, Susac)
- Symmetric vs asymmetric distribution helps narrow differential: symmetric suggests metabolic/toxic/genetic; asymmetric suggests vascular/inflammatory/infectious
- Enhancement pattern: no enhancement (CSVD, PML, chronic); ring enhancement (abscess, lymphoma); leptomeningeal (sarcoid, carcinomatosis); lesion-associated (MS active, vasculitis)
- Microbleed distribution on SWI helps differentiate: lobar (cerebral amyloid angiopathy); deep/infratentorial (hypertensive CSVD)
- Many etiologies are treatable (B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, neurosyphilis, vasculitis, MS), making thorough workup essential
- Cognitive impairment in white matter disease often manifests as executive dysfunction and processing speed deficits rather than memory loss (distinguishing from Alzheimer disease)
- Vascular risk factor management is the cornerstone of treatment for CSVD-related white matter disease; aggressive BP control is the single most impactful intervention
