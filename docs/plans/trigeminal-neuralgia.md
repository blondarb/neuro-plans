## NOTES

- Trigeminal neuralgia is a clinical diagnosis; MRI identifies secondary causes and surgical planning
- Classical TN: Brief (seconds to 2 minutes), electric shock-like, triggered by touch/chewing/talking
- Carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine are FIRST-LINE; 70-80% initial response
- Oxcarbazepine may be better tolerated but causes more hyponatremia
- HLA-B*1502 screening REQUIRED in patients of Asian ancestry before carbamazepine (SJS/TEN risk)
- Lamotrigine requires SLOW titration (SJS risk); useful as add-on therapy
- If sensory loss or continuous pain present → consider secondary TN (tumor, MS)
- MVD is most effective long-term treatment for classical TN with vascular compression (70-80% pain-free at 10 years)
- Percutaneous procedures and radiosurgery are alternatives for high surgical risk or no vascular compression
- V1 (ophthalmic) TN is least common; if present, ensure corneal protection if procedures cause sensory loss
- Pain remission can occur spontaneously; some patients may be able to taper medications
- MS-related TN is often bilateral and more difficult to treat
