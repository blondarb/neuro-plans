**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) Types I and II in adults. Includes Budapest diagnostic criteria, staging, etiologic workup, pharmacologic management (neuropathic pain agents, bisphosphonates, corticosteroids), interventional procedures (sympathetic blocks, spinal cord stimulation), and rehabilitation (graded motor imagery, mirror therapy). Covers ED acute pain management, inpatient evaluation, outpatient chronic management, and ICU-level ketamine infusion protocols. Excludes other chronic pain syndromes unless part of differential.

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **CRPS Type I (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy):** Regional pain syndrome occurring after an inciting noxious event (fracture, surgery, immobilization) without a definable nerve lesion; disproportionate to inciting event
- **CRPS Type II (Causalgia):** Regional pain syndrome with a definable nerve lesion confirmed by electrodiagnostic studies or imaging
- **Budapest Criteria:** Validated clinical diagnostic criteria requiring symptoms in 3 or more categories and signs in 2 or more categories from: sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor/edema, and motor/trophic domains
- **Sympathetically Maintained Pain (SMP):** Pain component mediated by sympathetic efferent activity; responsive to sympathetic blockade
- **Sympathetically Independent Pain (SIP):** Pain component that persists despite sympathetic blockade
- **Allodynia:** Pain from a stimulus that does not normally provoke pain (e.g., light touch)
- **Hyperalgesia:** Increased pain from a stimulus that normally provokes pain
- **Budapest Criteria Categories:** (1) Sensory — allodynia, hyperalgesia, hyperesthesia; (2) Vasomotor — temperature asymmetry >1°C, skin color changes; (3) Sudomotor/edema — edema, sweating changes, sweating asymmetry; (4) Motor/trophic — decreased ROM, weakness, tremor, dystonia, trophic changes (hair, nail, skin)

## NOTES

- CRPS is a clinical diagnosis; no single laboratory test or imaging study confirms the diagnosis — Budapest criteria are the accepted standard
- Budapest criteria require: >=1 symptom in 3 of 4 categories AND >=1 sign in 2 of 4 categories (sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor/edema, motor/trophic) AND no better explanation
- CRPS Type I (no nerve lesion) accounts for ~90% of cases; Type II (definable nerve lesion) accounts for ~10%
- Historical staging (Acute/Warm -> Dystrophic/Mixed -> Atrophic/Cold) is controversial and not consistently observed; many patients do not progress linearly
- Early aggressive treatment (within 3-6 months of onset) yields significantly better outcomes; delays worsen prognosis
- Bisphosphonates have among the strongest RCT evidence for CRPS pain reduction and should not be overlooked
- Multidisciplinary approach (pain medicine, PT/OT, psychology) is essential; no single intervention is sufficient
- Avoid immobilization; it worsens CRPS — early mobilization is a core treatment principle
- SCS is FDA-approved for CRPS and has Level I evidence; DRG stimulation may be superior for focal CRPS
- IV ketamine should be administered in monitored settings only; outpatient infusion centers may be appropriate for experienced patients
- Surgery on the affected limb can trigger CRPS flare or spread; preoperative sympathetic block may mitigate risk
- Recurrence/spread to other limbs occurs in approximately 7-10% of patients
