---

**KEY DEFINITIONS:**

- **Brain Death / Death by Neurologic Criteria (DNC):** Irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brainstem (Uniform Determination of Death Act, 1981)
- **Clinical Examination:** Assessment of coma (absence of consciousness) and brainstem areflexia (absence of all brainstem reflexes)
- **Apnea Test:** Confirmatory test for absence of respiratory drive from the brainstem
- **Ancillary Test:** Supplementary diagnostic test used when clinical examination or apnea test cannot be completed, or when confounders cannot be excluded
- **Confounder:** Any condition that may mimic brain death findings and must be excluded before proceeding with determination

**CRITICAL FRAMEWORK:**

Brain death determination is a **clinical diagnosis**. The clinical examination (including apnea testing) is the gold standard. Ancillary tests are supplementary and used only when clinical testing is incomplete or confounders cannot be excluded.

**LEGAL NOTE:** Brain death determination requirements vary by state and institution. Clinicians must be familiar with local laws, institutional policies, and specific requirements regarding:

- Number of examinations required (1 vs. 2)
- Time interval between examinations
- Qualifications of examining physicians
- Mandatory ancillary testing requirements
- Religious/conscientious objection accommodations (e.g., New Jersey)

### 2B. Ancillary Tests (When Clinical Examination Cannot Be Completed)

**INDICATIONS FOR ANCILLARY TESTING (AAN 2023):**

- Clinical examination cannot be fully performed (e.g., severe facial/orbital trauma precluding pupil or corneal testing)
- Apnea test cannot be completed or is inconclusive (e.g., hemodynamic instability, severe ARDS with baseline hypercarbia)
- Confounders cannot be resolved (e.g., CNS depressant drugs cannot be cleared in timely fashion, hypothermia refractory to rewarming)
- Institutional policy requires ancillary testing
- To shorten observation period between examinations (if allowed by institutional policy)

### 3D. Medications to AVOID During Brain Death Examination

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| All sedatives (propofol, midazolam, dexmedetomidine) | - | Must be discontinued ≥5 half-lives before clinical examination; active sedation invalidates brain death determination | - | Active sedation invalidates brain death examination | Drug levels if uncertain clearance; clinical assessment; ancillary testing if clearance uncertain | - | - | - | - |
| All opioids (fentanyl, morphine, hydromorphone) | - | Must be discontinued ≥5 half-lives before clinical examination; opioids suppress respiratory drive (invalidate apnea test) | - | Active opioids invalidate apnea test | Drug levels if uncertain clearance; naloxone reversal NOT sufficient (reversal may be incomplete; must confirm clearance) | - | - | - | - |
| Neuromuscular blocking agents (rocuronium, cisatracurium, vecuronium) | - | Must be fully reversed before clinical examination; paralysis prevents assessment of motor and respiratory function | - | Active paralysis completely invalidates all clinical brain death testing | Train-of-four monitoring: must show 4/4 twitches before examination; sugammadex reversal for rocuronium/vecuronium if needed; wait for spontaneous clearance of cisatracurium | - | - | - | - |
| Atropine (diagnostic test — should NOT be administered as treatment) | - | Atropine is used as a diagnostic test during brain death examination (IV bolus → no heart rate increase confirms vagal nucleus non-function); NOT a treatment | - | Not used therapeutically in this context; used diagnostically: 1 mg IV → if NO heart rate increase >3% → confirms brainstem non-function | Document pre- and post-atropine heart rate; absence of response supports brain death | - | - | - | - |

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

### Conditions That May Mimic Brain Death (Must Be Excluded)

| Condition | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Severe hypothermia (<32°C)** | History of exposure; core temperature <32°C; can cause fixed dilated pupils, absent reflexes, flat EEG; FULLY REVERSIBLE; "no one is dead until warm and dead" | Core temperature measurement; actively rewarm to ≥36°C before brain death examination; all clinical findings may normalize with rewarming |
| **CNS depressant drug intoxication** | History of overdose or recent sedative administration; barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, propofol, alcohol; can mimic all brain death findings including flat EEG | Comprehensive toxicology screen; specific drug levels; wait ≥5 half-lives for clearance; if cannot wait, use ancillary testing (cerebral blood flow study NOT affected by drugs) |
| **Severe metabolic derangement** | Hepatic encephalopathy (ammonia >200); severe hyponatremia or hypernatremia; diabetic coma; severe uremia; hyperosmolar state | CMP; ammonia; osmolality; ABG; correct derangement and reassess; if uncorrectable, ancillary testing |
| **Locked-in syndrome** | Basilar artery occlusion/pontine stroke; patient is CONSCIOUS but appears unresponsive; preserved vertical eye movements and blinking; normal EEG | Ask patient to "look up" and "blink"; EEG shows normal alpha rhythm; MRI brainstem shows pontine lesion; brain death exam: pupils reactive, corneal reflex may be present |
| **Guillain-Barre syndrome (severe/Miller Fisher variant)** | Ascending paralysis; areflexia; may have facial diplegia and ophthalmoplegia; cranial nerve involvement can mimic brainstem areflexia | CSF: albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein, normal cells); NCS/EMG: demyelinating pattern; anti-GQ1b antibodies; EEG shows normal cerebral activity; cerebral blood flow is NORMAL |
| **High cervical spinal cord injury** | Complete cord transection above C3 → apnea, quadriplegia, areflexia below lesion; BUT brainstem reflexes PRESERVED (pupillary, corneal, oculovestibular) | MRI cervical spine; brainstem reflexes intact on examination; EEG shows cerebral activity; cerebral blood flow normal |
| **Severe myasthenia gravis crisis** | Generalized weakness including cranial nerve and respiratory muscles; may appear unresponsive with absent reflexes; pupil reactivity usually preserved | Edrophonium/ice pack test; NCS with repetitive stimulation: decremental response; acetylcholine receptor antibodies; EEG: normal cerebral activity |
| **Baclofen intoxication (intrathecal pump malfunction)** | Intrathecal baclofen overdose can cause deep coma, areflexia, absent respiratory drive; REVERSIBLE | History of intrathecal baclofen pump; check pump function; CSF baclofen level; supportive care until clearance; EEG may show slowing but NOT electrocerebral inactivity; cerebral blood flow normal |
| **Posterior fossa hemorrhage with brainstem compression** | Acute cerebellar hemorrhage compressing brainstem; may present with absent brainstem reflexes; potentially surgically treatable | CT head: posterior fossa hemorrhage; neurosurgical evaluation for emergent decompression BEFORE declaring brain death; surgical evacuation may be life-saving |
| **Severe hypothyroidism (myxedema coma)** | Profound hypothermia, coma, hypoventilation, bradycardia; very slow reflexes may appear absent | TSH markedly elevated; free T4 very low; treat with IV levothyroxine and hydrocortisone; reassess after thyroid hormone replacement |

### Conditions Causing Irreversible Coma (NOT Brain Death)

| Condition | Key Features | Brain Death Status |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Persistent vegetative state (UWS)** | Eyes open, sleep-wake cycles, no awareness; brainstem function INTACT | NOT brain death — brainstem reflexes present; breathing spontaneously |
| **Minimally conscious state** | Inconsistent but reproducible evidence of awareness; follows commands intermittently | NOT brain death — evidence of consciousness |
| **Anencephaly** | Congenital absence of cerebral hemispheres; brainstem present and functioning | NOT brain death — brainstem functions intact; different legal/ethical considerations |

## 6. MONITORING PARAMETERS

### During Brain Death Evaluation and Donor Management

| Parameter | Frequency | Target/Threshold | Action if Abnormal | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Core temperature (esophageal/rectal/bladder) | Continuous | ≥36°C (96.8°F) for valid examination; 36-38°C for donor management | If <36°C: active rewarming; do NOT proceed with examination; if >38°C: cooling measures | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Arterial blood pressure (invasive — arterial line) | Continuous | MAP ≥60 mmHg for valid exam; MAP 60-100 for donor management | Hypotension: IV fluids → vasopressin → norepinephrine; escalate per donor protocol | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Heart rate and cardiac rhythm (telemetry) | Continuous | Sinus rhythm; HR 60-120; avoid hemodynamically significant arrhythmias | Arrhythmia: correct electrolytes (K, Mg, Ca); standard ACLS if needed; atropine test: no HR response expected in brain death | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| SpO2 (pulse oximetry) | Continuous | ≥95% (≥92% during apnea test is acceptable if O2 supplementation ongoing) | <85% during apnea test → ABORT test and reconnect ventilator; troubleshoot; consider ancillary testing | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Urine output (Foley) | Hourly | 0.5-3 mL/kg/hr; >300 mL/hr = likely DI | DI (>300 mL/hr, dilute urine, rising Na): desmopressin 1-4 mcg IV; replace volume; monitor sodium q2h | - | STAT | - | STAT |
| Serum sodium | q2-4h (more frequently if DI) | 135-155 mEq/L for donor management; avoid rapid swings | Rising Na + polyuria → DI → desmopressin + volume replacement; falling Na → adjust desmopressin | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| ABG (arterial blood gas) | q4-6h; pre/post apnea test | pH 7.25-7.45; PaCO2 35-45 (baseline); PaO2 >80; apnea test targets | Acidosis: sodium bicarbonate if pH <7.2; ventilator adjustments; apnea test ABGs are critical for determination | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Blood glucose | q1-2h during insulin drip; q4h otherwise | 120-180 mg/dL | <70: D50 bolus; >180: start/increase insulin infusion; steroid-induced hyperglycemia common | - | STAT | - | STAT |
| Serial neurologic checks (GCS, pupils, brainstem reflexes) | q1-2h pre-determination | GCS 3; fixed dilated pupils bilaterally; absent brainstem reflexes | Any improvement → brain death cannot be diagnosed; reassess; look for confounders | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| CVP (central venous pressure) | Continuous if CVC placed | 4-12 mmHg for donor management | Low: volume resuscitation; high: restrict fluids (protect lungs); diuretics if pulmonary edema | - | STAT | - | STAT |
| Troponin (serial) | q6-12h during donor management | Trending down; severely elevated → cardiology evaluation | Rising troponin: echocardiography; may affect cardiac donation suitability; neurogenic cardiac injury common | - | STAT | - | STAT |

---

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

### Brain Death Evaluation Disposition

| Disposition | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| **ICU admission** | All patients undergoing brain death evaluation require ICU-level care; mechanical ventilation; continuous hemodynamic monitoring; arterial line; vasopressor support; hourly neuro checks; controlled environment for apnea testing |
| **Continue ICU for organ donation** | After brain death declaration with organ donation consent: continue ICU-level care for donor management (hemodynamic optimization, hormone replacement, organ preservation); OPO manages care; OR scheduling for organ recovery |
| **Ventilator discontinuation** | After brain death declaration WITHOUT organ donation: family notification → reasonable time for family to visit → ventilator discontinuation; patient is legally dead — ventilator removal is NOT "withdrawal of care" |
| **Morgue/funeral home** | After ventilator removal (non-donor) or after organ recovery (donor): standard post-mortem care; death certificate completed with time of brain death determination; autopsy per institutional/legal requirements |
| **Delayed determination** | If confounders cannot be excluded (e.g., recent sedative administration): continue ICU care; repeat evaluation after drug clearance (≥5 half-lives); consider ancillary testing if clearance uncertain or delayed |
| **Contested brain death** | If family contests: ethics consultation; social work; chaplain; legal counsel; reasonable accommodation; NJ religious exemption if applicable; continue ICU care during resolution |
| **Transfer considerations** | If institution lacks resources for ancillary testing: arrange transfer to facility with nuclear medicine, angiography, or neurophysiology capabilities; OPO may facilitate transfer |

## APPENDIX B: Apnea Test Troubleshooting

```
APNEA TEST — COMMON PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

PROBLEM: Patient desaturates (SpO2 <85%) during test
→ SOLUTION: Reconnect ventilator immediately
→ Ensure adequate pre-oxygenation (PaO2 >200 before disconnection)
→ Verify O2 flow rate at carina (6-10 L/min)
→ Consider T-piece with CPAP 5-10 cmH2O instead of open disconnection
→ If cannot maintain SpO2 >85% for 8-10 min: ANCILLARY TEST required

PROBLEM: Hemodynamic instability (MAP <60) during test
→ SOLUTION: Optimize vasopressors BEFORE test
→ Bolus vasopressin 1 unit IV before disconnection
→ Ensure adequate volume resuscitation
→ If unstable despite optimization: ANCILLARY TEST required

PROBLEM: Baseline PaCO2 elevated (chronic hypercarbia, e.g., COPD)
→ SOLUTION: Document patient's chronic PaCO2 baseline
→ Adjusted targets: PaCO2 must rise ≥20 mmHg above CHRONIC baseline
   AND reach ≥60 mmHg absolute
→ May require longer observation period
→ AAN 2023: Acceptable to use chronic baseline as starting point

PROBLEM: PaCO2 target not reached after 8-10 minutes
→ SOLUTION: Continue observation up to 15 minutes if hemodynamically stable
→ Draw repeat ABG at 10 and 15 minutes
→ If still not reached: test is INCONCLUSIVE — need ancillary test
→ Note: CO2 typically rises 3-5 mmHg/min during apnea

PROBLEM: Observed movement during test
→ SOLUTION: CAREFULLY distinguish:
  - Spinal reflexes (acceptable — do NOT negate brain death):
    • Triple flexion of legs
    • Finger flexion/extension
    • Shoulder shrugging (rare)
    • Lazarus sign (arm raising — spinal cord mediated)
  - TRUE respiratory effort (NEGATES brain death):
    • Rhythmic chest/abdominal excursion
    • Active diaphragmatic contraction
    • Gas flow through ETT
→ If uncertain: ABORT test, reassess, video record if available

PROBLEM: Patient on ECMO
→ SOLUTION: ECMO adds significant complexity to brain death determination
→ Apnea test on ECMO requires specialized protocol:
  - Reduce ECMO sweep gas to minimum/off
  - Wait for PaCO2 to rise to target via native circulation
  - Institutional-specific protocol REQUIRED
→ Consider ancillary testing (cerebral blood flow study) instead
→ Consult institutional brain death policy and ECMO team

HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY (HRT) BUNDLE:
1. Vasopressin: 1 unit IV bolus → 0.5-2.4 units/hr
2. Levothyroxine (T4): 20 mcg IV bolus → 10 mcg/hr
   (or T3: 4 mcg bolus → 3 mcg/hr)
3. Methylprednisolone: 15 mg/kg IV x1 (max 1 g)
4. Insulin drip: Target BG 120-180 mg/dL

VENTILATOR SETTINGS:
• Tidal volume: 6-8 mL/kg IBW
• PEEP: 5-10 cmH2O
• FiO2: Titrate to SpO2 >95%
• Target: PaO2/FiO2 ≥300
• Recruitment maneuvers PRN

FLUID MANAGEMENT:
• CVP 4-12 mmHg
• Balanced crystalloid preferred
• Replace DI losses mL-for-mL
• Avoid overhydration (damages lungs)
• Transfuse if Hgb <7 g/dL

ELECTROLYTES:
• Na: 135-160 (desmopressin for DI)
• K: 3.5-5.0 (replace aggressively)
• Mg: >1.5 mg/dL
• Ca (ionized): 1.0-1.3 mmol/L
• Phos: 2.5-4.5 mg/dL

## APPENDIX D: State-Specific Considerations

| State/Jurisdiction | Special Requirement | Notes |
|--------------------|---------------------|-------|
| **New Jersey** | Religious exemption: if family objects to brain death on religious grounds, patient remains legally alive on ventilator | Only state with statutory religious exemption; physician must accommodate; no time limit specified |
| **New York** | Must provide "reasonable accommodation" for religious and moral objections to brain death | Not as absolute as NJ; case-by-case; institutional policies vary |
| **California** | Requires "reasonable time" for family before ventilator withdrawal after brain death; OPO notification required | Recently legislated additional family protections |
| **Most states** | 1 examination by qualified physician sufficient per AAN guidelines; institutional policy may require 2 examinations | Check institutional policy and state regulations; some states specify examiner qualifications |
| **Pediatric** | AAP/CNS/SCCM 2011: 2 examinations required; observation period varies by age (24h for term newborns to 30 days; 12h for 30 days to 18 years); longer intervals recommended in younger children | This template covers ADULTS only; pediatric brain death determination follows separate guidelines |
