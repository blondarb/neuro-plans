# Neurotoxicology

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** February 11, 2026
**REVISED:** February 11, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Neurotoxicology — Drug-Induced Neurotoxicity Syndromes

**ICD-10:** G92.8 (Other toxic encephalopathy), G92.9 (Toxic encephalopathy, unspecified), T43.8X5A (Adverse effect of other psychotropic drugs — lithium), T36.1X5A (Adverse effect of cephalosporins — cefepime), T45.1X5A (Adverse effect of antineoplastic/immunosuppressive drugs — checkpoint inhibitors), G04.81 (Other encephalitis — checkpoint inhibitor encephalitis)

**CPT CODES:** 80178 (Lithium level), 80299 (Quantitative drug level, not elsewhere specified — cefepime trough), 85025 (CBC with differential), 80053 (CMP), 82140 (Ammonia), 83519 (Immunoassay, analyte, quantitative — autoimmune encephalitis panel), 89050 (CSF cell count), 89051 (CSF differential), 70551 (MRI brain without contrast), 70553 (MRI brain with and without contrast), 95816 (EEG, awake and asleep), 95950 (Continuous EEG monitoring), 90935 (Hemodialysis, single session)

**SYNONYMS:** Neurotoxicology, drug-induced neurotoxicity, medication neurotoxicity, lithium neurotoxicity, cefepime neurotoxicity, cefepime-induced encephalopathy, checkpoint inhibitor encephalitis, immune-related adverse event encephalitis, irAE encephalitis, immunotherapy neurotoxicity, toxic encephalopathy, drug-induced encephalopathy

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of drug-induced neurotoxicity syndromes in adults. Covers three high-yield syndromes: (1) Lithium neurotoxicity, (2) Cefepime neurotoxicity/encephalopathy, and (3) Checkpoint inhibitor (immune checkpoint inhibitor) encephalitis. Includes recognition, diagnostic workup, acute treatment, and monitoring. Excludes chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (separate plan), neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and serotonin syndrome (addressed in other contexts).

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Lithium Neurotoxicity:** Neurological dysfunction from lithium accumulation; can occur at therapeutic or supratherapeutic levels
- **SILENT (Syndrome of Irreversible Lithium-Effectuated Neurotoxicity):** Persistent neurological deficits after lithium toxicity despite level normalization
- **Cefepime Neurotoxicity:** Encephalopathy/seizures from cefepime accumulation, especially with renal impairment; often presents with myoclonus and NCSE
- **Checkpoint Inhibitor Encephalitis:** Autoimmune encephalitis triggered by anti-PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA-4 immunotherapy (irAE); graded 1-4 by CTCAE
- **irAE (immune-related Adverse Event):** Autoimmune toxicity from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy

---

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

---

!!! danger "TREATABLE AND REVERSIBLE IF RECOGNIZED EARLY"
    **Drug-induced neurotoxicity is commonly underdiagnosed.** Cefepime neurotoxicity, lithium toxicity, and checkpoint inhibitor encephalitis are all treatable but require prompt recognition and intervention. Always consider medication-induced causes in any unexplained encephalopathy.

!!! warning "CEFEPIME NEUROTOXICITY IS UNDERRECOGNIZED"
    Up to 15% of patients on cefepime may develop neurotoxicity. **EEG is essential** — triphasic waves and nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) are common findings. Symptoms resolve 24-72 hours after drug discontinuation in most cases.

## NOTES

- **Cefepime neurotoxicity is significantly underrecognized** — studies suggest up to 15% incidence in hospitalized patients, yet it is frequently missed because symptoms (confusion, myoclonus) mimic other causes of ICU delirium. Always consider cefepime as a cause of new-onset encephalopathy in any patient receiving this antibiotic, especially with renal impairment.
- **Lithium toxicity can occur at therapeutic serum levels** — dehydration, acute kidney injury, drug interactions (NSAIDs, ACEi, diuretics), and intercurrent illness can precipitate neurotoxicity even when lithium levels remain within the 0.6-1.2 mEq/L range. Clinical symptoms should guide management, not the level alone.
- **Checkpoint inhibitor encephalitis typically presents weeks to months after starting immunotherapy** — median onset is 6-12 weeks but can occur at any time, including after treatment discontinuation. Maintain a high index of suspicion for any neurological change in patients on or recently treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA-4 therapy.
- **The SILENT syndrome (Syndrome of Irreversible Lithium-Effectuated Neurotoxicity)** is a rare but devastating consequence of lithium toxicity characterized by persistent cerebellar dysfunction, dementia, and movement disorders despite lithium level normalization. Early aggressive treatment (hydration, hemodialysis) may reduce risk.
- **EEG is the single most important diagnostic study for cefepime neurotoxicity** — triphasic waves and generalized periodic discharges are highly suggestive. Continuous EEG monitoring should be obtained in any ICU patient on cefepime with unexplained altered mental status.
