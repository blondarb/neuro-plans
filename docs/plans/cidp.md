**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 29, 2026
**REVISED:** January 29, 2026
**STATUS:** Complete

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)

**ICD-10:** G61.81 (Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuritis), G61.89 (Other inflammatory polyneuropathies), G61.9 (Inflammatory polyneuropathy, unspecified)

**SYNONYMS:** CIDP, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, chronic relapsing polyneuropathy, chronic GBS, chronic acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy, immune-mediated neuropathy

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis and management of typical CIDP and CIDP variants in adults. Covers diagnostic criteria (EFNS/PNS), electrodiagnostic findings, immunotherapy options, and monitoring. Excludes acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barré syndrome), hereditary demyelinating neuropathies (CMT), and purely axonal chronic neuropathies.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **CIDP:** Immune-mediated sensorimotor polyneuropathy with progressive or relapsing course over >8 weeks
- **Typical CIDP:** Symmetric proximal and distal weakness, sensory involvement, areflexia
- **CIDP Variants:** DADS (Distal Acquired Demyelinating Symmetric), MADSAM (Multifocal Acquired Demyelinating Sensory and Motor), Pure sensory CIDP, Pure motor CIDP, Focal CIDP
- **Treatment-dependent CIDP:** Requires ongoing immunotherapy to maintain function

**DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (EFNS/PNS 2021):**

**Clinical Criteria (both required):**
1. Progressive or relapsing symmetric proximal and distal weakness AND sensory dysfunction of all extremities, developing over ≥8 weeks
2. Absent or reduced deep tendon reflexes in all extremities

**Supportive Clinical Features:**

## NOTES

- CIDP requires >8 weeks of progression to distinguish from GBS
- Albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein, normal cells) typical but not universal
- Three first-line treatments: IVIG, steroids, PLEX - choose based on patient factors
- IVIG preferred if rapid response needed, steroid side effects concern, or patient preference
- Steroids preferred if cost is major factor; pulsed IV may have fewer side effects than daily oral
- Many patients are "treatment-dependent" requiring indefinite maintenance therapy
- Anti-nodal antibody-positive CIDP (NF155, CNTN1, Caspr1) responds poorly to IVIG but well to rituximab
- Monitor for IVIG-related complications: renal impairment, thrombosis, aseptic meningitis
- Slow taper of any immunotherapy to identify minimum effective dose
