|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| CT head without contrast | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | IMMEDIATE (door-to-CT <25 min). Sensitivity: 98-100% within 6h; ~93% at 12h; ~85% at 24h; declines after 3-5 days | Hyperdense blood in basal cisterns, Sylvian fissure, interhemispheric fissure; modified Fisher grade; hydrocephalus; intraventricular hemorrhage | None significant |
| CT angiography (CTA) head | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | Simultaneously with non-contrast CT. Identifies aneurysm (sensitivity 95-100% for aneurysms >3mm) | Aneurysm location, size, morphology; multiple aneurysms (15-20% have >1); vasospasm (delayed) | Contrast allergy (premedicate); renal impairment (benefit outweighs risk) |
| ECG (12-lead) | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | Immediately | Deep T-wave inversions ("cerebral T waves"), ST changes, QT prolongation, arrhythmias — all may be neurogenic; do NOT misdiagnose as primary cardiac event | None |

### 2B. Extended

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Timing | Target Finding | Contraindications |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Conventional cerebral angiography (DSA) | - | STAT | - | STAT | Within 24h — GOLD STANDARD for aneurysm identification; also therapeutic (coiling). If CTA negative but clinical suspicion high, DSA is mandatory | Aneurysm (location, neck width, dome-to-neck ratio, relationship to branches); may find aneurysm missed by CTA; vasospasm assessment | Contrast allergy; renal impairment; coagulopathy (relative) |
| Repeat DSA (if initial negative) | - | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE | At 7-14 days if initial DSA negative and non-perimesencephalic pattern; small aneurysm may be thrombosed or compressed by hematoma | Previously missed aneurysm | Same as initial |
| MRI/MRA brain | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | When stable; helpful for subacute diagnosis or if CT negative but suspicion persists | Blood products (FLAIR); aneurysm (MRA); ischemia from vasospasm (DWI) | Pacemaker; hemodynamic instability |
| Transcranial Doppler (TCD) | - | STAT | - | STAT | Begin daily on post-bleed day 3; continue through day 14 (vasospasm window) | Mean flow velocities: MCA >120 cm/s concerning; >200 cm/s severe vasospasm. Lindegaard ratio >3 suggests vasospasm (>6 = severe) | Absent temporal bone window (~10%) |
| CT perfusion (CTP) | - | URGENT | - | URGENT | If vasospasm suspected clinically (new deficit days 4-14) | Perfusion deficits in vascular territory of spastic vessel; mismatch (reversible ischemia) | Contrast allergy; renal impairment |
| CTA (repeat for vasospasm) | - | URGENT | - | URGENT | If clinical vasospasm suspected | Arterial narrowing; correlate with TCD and clinical exam | Same as initial CTA |
| Echocardiogram (TTE) | - | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE | Within 24-48h | Takotsubo (apical ballooning); regional wall motion abnormalities; EF assessment — neurogenic stunned myocardium in 20-30% | None significant |
| Continuous EEG (cEEG) | - | URGENT | - | STAT | If altered consciousness; delayed deterioration; suspected seizures | Non-convulsive seizures; electrographic vasospasm correlate; periodic discharges | None |
| Chest X-ray | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | URGENT | On admission; daily in ICU | Neurogenic pulmonary edema; aspiration; ARDS | None |

### 2C. Rare/Specialized

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Timing | Target Finding | Contraindications |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| 3D rotational angiography | - | URGENT | - | URGENT | During DSA for complex aneurysm anatomy | Detailed aneurysm morphology for treatment planning | Same as DSA |
| Xenon CT or CT perfusion (quantitative) | - | EXT | - | EXT | Research/advanced vasospasm assessment | Quantitative cerebral blood flow mapping | Limited availability |
| MRA screening (unruptured aneurysm in family members) | - | - | ROUTINE | - | Elective — for first-degree relatives of SAH patients (2 or more affected family members) | Incidental unruptured aneurysm | Standard MRI contraindications |

### LUMBAR PUNCTURE

**Indication:** CT-negative suspected SAH. If CT head is normal but clinical suspicion (thunderclap headache "worst of my life") remains — LP is MANDATORY. Wait ≥6h (ideally 12h) from headache onset for xanthochromia to develop.

**Timing:** URGENT — but ≥6h from headache onset to allow xanthochromia development.

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | Rationale | Target Finding |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|-----------|----------------|
| Opening pressure | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Elevated in SAH | Often elevated (>20 cm H2O) |
| Cell count (tubes 1 AND 4) | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Distinguish SAH from traumatic tap: SAH = RBC count does NOT clear significantly between tube 1 and tube 4 | RBC in tube 4 ≥ tube 1 (SAH); if tube 4 << tube 1 = traumatic tap |
| Xanthochromia (visual and/or spectrophotometry) | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Yellow discoloration from RBC breakdown (bilirubin); develops >6h after SAH; spectrophotometry more sensitive than visual inspection | Present = SAH (sensitivity >95% at 12h-2 weeks post-bleed). Absent = unlikely SAH |
| Protein | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Elevated in SAH | Elevated |
| Glucose | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Usually normal in SAH | Normal |
| Gram stain and culture | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Exclude meningitis (meningeal signs overlap) | No organisms |

**Special Handling:** Xanthochromia sample must be protected from light (wrap tube in foil); centrifuge immediately; spectrophotometry if available (more sensitive than visual inspection).

**Note:** CT within 6h of ictus has near 100% sensitivity. If CT is obtained within 6h and is clearly negative, some guidelines suggest LP may not be needed if CTA is also negative. However, LP remains standard of care for CT-negative thunderclap headache in most institutions.

## 3. TREATMENT

### ⚠️ CRITICAL PRIORITIES
1. Secure the airway (if GCS ≤8)
2. Stabilize blood pressure (SBP <160 until aneurysm secured)
3. Identify and secure the aneurysm (clipping or coiling) as soon as possible (<24h)
4. Prevent and treat vasospasm (nimodipine, euvolemia)
5. Monitor for hydrocephalus (EVD if needed)

### 3A. Acute/Emergent

| Treatment | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring |
|-----------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|--------|-------------------|------------|
| Blood pressure control: Nicardipine IV | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | 5 mg/h IV; titrate by 2.5 mg/h q5-15min; max 15 mg/h. Target SBP <160 mmHg UNTIL aneurysm is secured (re-bleed risk highest in first 24h with uncontrolled HTN); after securing: target SBP <180 (or higher if vasospasm) | Severe aortic stenosis | Continuous arterial BP; neuro checks q1h |
| Blood pressure control: Labetalol IV | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | 10-20 mg IV q10-20min; max 300 mg. Alternative to nicardipine | Heart block; severe bradycardia; asthma | HR; BP continuous |
| Blood pressure control: Clevidipine IV | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | 1-2 mg/h IV; max 32 mg/h | Soy/egg allergy | BP continuous |
| Nimodipine (CORNERSTONE of vasospasm prevention) | - | STAT | - | STAT | 60 mg PO/NG q4h x 21 days. START within 96h of SAH onset. If hypotension: 30 mg q2h. This is an ORAL calcium channel blocker — do NOT give IV (severe hypotension). Proven to reduce poor outcomes from vasospasm | Hypotension (SBP <90 — reduce dose); do NOT crush extended-release formulations; use oral syringe if NG | BP with each dose; do NOT give IV; ensure enteral route only |
| External ventricular drain (EVD) | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | For acute hydrocephalus (GCS declining; CT showing ventriculomegaly); allows ICP monitoring and CSF drainage. Set drain height per neurosurgery (typically 15-20 cm above tragus) | Coagulopathy (correct first) | ICP continuous; CSF output q1h; drain position; infection surveillance (CSF culture q3 days per some protocols) |
| Seizure prophylaxis (short-term) | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | Levetiracetam 1000 mg IV/PO load, then 500-1000 mg BID. AHA 2012: short-term (3-7 days) prophylaxis is reasonable. Avoid phenytoin (associated with worse cognitive outcomes in SAH — Naidech et al.) | Renal impairment (dose adjust) | Seizure monitoring |
| Intubation / Airway protection | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | GCS ≤8; inability to protect airway; respiratory failure; impending herniation | N/A | Avoid hypotension during RSI; maintain SBP goal |
| Aminocaproic acid (antifibrinolytic) | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | 4g IV load then 1g/h IV infusion. ONLY use for short-term (<72h) if aneurysm securing will be delayed. Reduces re-bleeding risk but increases thrombotic risk. Discontinue once aneurysm is secured | Active DIC; DVT/PE; renal impairment | Coagulation; thrombotic events; discontinue when aneurysm treated |
| IV isotonic fluids (euvolemia) | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | NS at 1-1.5 mL/kg/h (80-125 mL/h); goal euvolemia. Avoid hypovolemia (worsens vasospasm) and avoid aggressive hypervolemia (no proven benefit; risk of pulmonary edema). Target CVP 5-8 or clinical euvolemia | Volume overload; CHF | I/O; daily weights; CVP if central line; serum Na q6-8h |
| Stress ulcer prophylaxis: Pantoprazole | - | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE | 40 mg IV/PO daily | C. diff risk | GI symptoms |
| DVT prophylaxis: Pneumatic compression devices | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | Apply bilaterally on admission; SAH patients are HIGH VTE risk | Acute DVT | Skin checks |
| DVT prophylaxis: Heparin SC (after aneurysm secured) | - | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE | 5000 units SC q8h; start 24h after aneurysm is secured (clipping or coiling); some centers start earlier | Active bleeding; within 24h of craniotomy (per surgeon) | Platelets q3 days |

### 3B. Aneurysm Securing (Definitive Treatment)

| Treatment | Timing | Details | Indications | Contraindications |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Endovascular coiling | Within 24h of diagnosis (ideally <12h) | Interventional neuroradiology; catheter-based platinum coil deployment into aneurysm sac. Preferred per ISAT trial for posterior circulation and many anterior circulation aneurysms | Most aneurysms; wide-necked aneurysms may need stent-assisted coiling or flow diverter | Difficult vascular access; very wide neck without stent option |
| Surgical clipping (craniotomy) | Within 24h of diagnosis (ideally <12h) | Neurosurgical; microsurgical clip placement across aneurysm neck | MCA aneurysms (preferred); large intracerebral hematoma requiring evacuation; failed coiling; aneurysm anatomy not amenable to coiling | Poor grade with brain swelling (relative — may clip if accessible); medically unstable |
| Flow diverter (Pipeline, FRED) | Planned | For large/giant or wide-necked aneurysms not amenable to standard coiling | Complex aneurysm morphology | Requires dual antiplatelet therapy (may not be ideal in acute SAH) |

### 3C. Vasospasm Treatment (Post-Bleed Days 4-14)

| Treatment | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring |
|-----------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|--------|-------------------|------------|

| Induced hypertension | - | - | - | STAT | If clinical vasospasm (new deficit days 4-14, aneurysm MUST be secured first): raise SBP to 180-220 mmHg using vasopressors. Phenylephrine 0.5-5 µg/kg/min or norepinephrine 0.05-0.3 µg/kg/min IV | Unsecured aneurysm (NEVER induce hypertension before securing); cardiac failure; pulmonary edema | Arterial line; neuro checks q1h; TCD; CT perfusion |
| IV fluid bolus (euvolemia maintenance) | - | - | - | STAT | NS bolus 500-1000 mL if hypovolemic; maintain euvolemia. Avoid prophylactic hypervolemia (no benefit per current evidence — Robertson et al.) | Volume overload | CVP; I/O; daily weights |
| Milrinone IV (alternative vasospasm treatment) | - | - | - | STAT | 0.25-0.75 µg/kg/min IV continuous; some centers use as rescue for vasospasm not responding to induced hypertension; acts as cerebral vasodilator | Severe hypotension; arrhythmia | BP (may cause hypotension); HR; cardiac output |
| Intra-arterial vasodilator therapy (endovascular rescue) | - | - | - | STAT | Verapamil 5-10 mg intra-arterial or nicardipine 5-10 mg intra-arterial; via catheter into spastic vessel during angiography. For medically refractory vasospasm | Hemodynamic instability during procedure | Angiographic improvement; clinical response; BP |
| Angioplasty (balloon) | - | - | - | STAT | Mechanical dilation of spastic proximal vessels during angiography. For focal proximal vasospasm refractory to medical treatment | Vessel rupture risk; distal vasospasm (not amenable to balloon) | Angiographic result; clinical response |
| Magnesium sulfate (supplemental) | - | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE | Target serum Mg >2.0 mg/dL; replete with MgSO4 2-4 g IV over 1-2h PRN. MASH-2 trial: IV magnesium infusion did NOT improve outcomes, but maintaining normal-high Mg is standard | Renal failure; hypermagnesemia | Serum Mg q12-24h; deep tendon reflexes |

### 3D. Complications Management

| Treatment | Indication | Dosing | Monitoring |
|-----------|------------|--------|------------|
| Hyponatremia management: Differentiate CSW vs SIADH | Na <135: CSW = volume depleted (treat with NS/hypertonic saline + fludrocortisone). SIADH = euvolemic (treat with fluid restriction ± hypertonic saline) | CSW: NS or 3% saline; fludrocortisone 0.1-0.2 mg PO BID. SIADH: fluid restriction 1-1.2 L/day; 3% saline if <120 | Na q6h during correction; avoid >8-10 mEq/L rise in 24h (central pontine myelinolysis risk) |
| Fludrocortisone | Cerebral salt wasting (volume depletion + hyponatremia) | 0.1-0.2 mg PO BID | Na; K+ (hypokalemia); volume status; BP |
| Hydrocortisone | Refractory hyponatremia; cerebral salt wasting; adrenal insufficiency | 50-100 mg IV q8h | Na; glucose; cortisol |
| Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) | Chronic hydrocephalus (EVD-dependent; unable to wean) | Neurosurgical procedure | Shunt function; neurologic status |

| Nimodipine 60 mg PO q4h x 21 days | Class I, Level A | Pickard et al. (BMJ 1989); only proven agent to improve outcomes in SAH vasospasm |
| Early aneurysm securing (<24h, ideally <12h) | Class I, Level B | ISAT; AHA/ASA 2012 SAH Guidelines; de Gans et al. (Stroke 2002) |
| Endovascular coiling preferred over clipping for most aneurysms | Class I, Level A | ISAT trial (Molyneux et al. Lancet 2002); long-term follow-up |
| SBP <160 until aneurysm secured | Class I, Level B | AHA/ASA 2012 SAH Guidelines |
| Euvolemia (avoid hypovolemia; avoid prophylactic hypervolemia) | Class I, Level B | Lennihan et al. (Stroke 2000); HIMALAIA trial |
| Induced hypertension for clinical vasospasm (after aneurysm secured) | Class IIa, Level B | AHA/ASA Guidelines; standard practice |
| TCD daily for vasospasm monitoring | Class IIa, Level B | Sloan et al. (2004); AHA/ASA Guidelines |
| Short-term seizure prophylaxis (3-7 days) reasonable | Class IIb, Level B | AHA/ASA 2012 |
| Avoid phenytoin in SAH (worse cognitive outcomes) | Class III (Harm) | Naidech et al. (Neurocrit Care 2005) |
| CT sensitivity ~100% within 6h | Class I, Level A | Perry et al. (BMJ 2011); Backes et al. (Stroke 2012) |
| LP if CT negative but clinical suspicion | Class I, Level B | AHA/ASA Guidelines; standard of care |
| Aminocaproic acid (short-term) if aneurysm securing delayed | Class IIa, Level B | Hillman et al. (Neurosurgery 2002); AHA/ASA 2012 |
| Magnesium infusion does NOT improve outcomes | Class III (No Benefit) | MASH-2 trial (Dorhout Mees et al. Lancet 2012) |
| Fludrocortisone for cerebral salt wasting | Class IIa, Level B | Hasan et al. (Stroke 1989) |
| Intra-arterial vasodilator / balloon angioplasty for refractory vasospasm | Class IIa, Level B | Multiple case series; AHA/ASA Guidelines |
| Avoid self-fulfilling prophecy in poor-grade SAH | Class I, Level C | AHA/ASA 2012: aggressive treatment for at least 72h in poor-grade |

**APPENDIX: HUNT AND HESS GRADING SCALE**

| Grade | Description | Approximate Mortality |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| I | Asymptomatic or mild headache, slight nuchal rigidity | ~1% |
| II | Moderate-severe headache, nuchal rigidity, no neurologic deficit other than cranial nerve palsy | ~5% |
| III | Drowsiness, confusion, or mild focal deficit | ~19% |
| IV | Stupor, moderate-severe hemiparesis, possible early decerebrate rigidity | ~42% |
| V | Deep coma, decerebrate rigidity, moribund appearance | ~77% |

**APPENDIX: MODIFIED FISHER GRADE (Vasospasm Risk)**

| Grade | CT Findings | Vasospasm Risk |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 0 | No SAH or IVH | Very low |
| 1 | Thin SAH, no IVH | Low (24%) |
| 2 | Thin SAH, with IVH | Moderate (33%) |
| 3 | Thick SAH, no IVH | High (33%) |
| 4 | Thick SAH, with IVH | Very high (40%) |

**APPENDIX: CEREBRAL SALT WASTING vs SIADH**

| Feature | Cerebral Salt Wasting | SIADH |
|---------|----------------------|-------|
| Volume status | Hypovolemic (dehydrated) | Euvolemic |
| Serum Na | Low (<135) | Low (<135) |
| Urine Na | High (>40) | High (>40) |
| Urine osm | High | High |
| Treatment | Volume replacement (NS, hypertonic saline); fludrocortisone | Fluid restriction; hypertonic saline if severe |
| Key differentiator | Clinical dehydration (tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, elevated BUN:Cr ratio, negative fluid balance) | Clinically euvolemic |
