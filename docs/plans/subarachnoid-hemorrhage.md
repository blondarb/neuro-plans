### 2B. Extended

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Timing | Target Finding | Contraindications |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Conventional cerebral angiography (DSA) (CPT 36224) | - | STAT | - | STAT | Within 24h — GOLD STANDARD for aneurysm identification; also therapeutic (coiling). If CTA negative but clinical suspicion high, DSA is mandatory | Aneurysm (location, neck width, dome-to-neck ratio, relationship to branches); may find aneurysm missed by CTA; vasospasm assessment | Contrast allergy; renal impairment; coagulopathy (relative) |
| Repeat DSA (if initial negative) | - | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE | At 7-14 days if initial DSA negative and non-perimesencephalic pattern; small aneurysm may be thrombosed or compressed by hematoma | Previously missed aneurysm | Same as initial |
| MRI/MRA brain | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | When stable; helpful for subacute diagnosis or if CT negative but suspicion persists | Blood products (FLAIR); aneurysm (MRA); ischemia from vasospasm (DWI) | Pacemaker; hemodynamic instability |
| Transcranial Doppler (TCD) (CPT 93886) | - | STAT | - | STAT | Begin daily on post-bleed day 3; continue through day 14 (vasospasm window) | Mean flow velocities: MCA >120 cm/s concerning; >200 cm/s severe vasospasm. Lindegaard ratio >3 suggests vasospasm (>6 = severe) | Absent temporal bone window (~10%) |
| CT perfusion (CTP) (CPT 0042T) | - | URGENT | - | URGENT | If vasospasm suspected clinically (new deficit days 4-14) | Perfusion deficits in vascular territory of spastic vessel; mismatch (reversible ischemia) | Contrast allergy; renal impairment |

| Chest X-ray (CPT 71046) | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | URGENT | On admission; daily in ICU | Neurogenic pulmonary edema; aspiration; ARDS | None |

### 2C. Rare/Specialized

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Timing | Target Finding | Contraindications |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| 3D rotational angiography | - | URGENT | - | URGENT | During DSA for complex aneurysm anatomy | Detailed aneurysm morphology for treatment planning | Same as DSA |
| Xenon CT or CT perfusion (quantitative) | - | EXT | - | EXT | Research/advanced vasospasm assessment | Quantitative cerebral blood flow mapping | Limited availability |
| MRA screening (unruptured aneurysm in family members) | - | - | ROUTINE | - | Elective — for first-degree relatives of SAH patients (2 or more affected family members) | Incidental unruptured aneurysm | Standard MRI contraindications |

### LUMBAR PUNCTURE

**Indication:** CT-negative suspected SAH. If CT head is normal but clinical suspicion (thunderclap headache "worst of my life") remains — LP (CPT 62270) is MANDATORY. Wait ≥6h (ideally 12h) from headache onset for xanthochromia to develop.

**Timing:** URGENT — but ≥6h from headache onset to allow xanthochromia development.

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | Rationale | Target Finding |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|-----------|----------------|
| Opening pressure | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Elevated in SAH | Often elevated (>20 cm H2O) |
| Cell count (tubes 1 AND 4) | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Distinguish SAH from traumatic tap: SAH = RBC count does NOT clear significantly between tube 1 and tube 4 | RBC in tube 4 ≥ tube 1 (SAH); if tube 4 << tube 1 = traumatic tap |
| Xanthochromia (visual and/or spectrophotometry) | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Yellow discoloration from RBC breakdown (bilirubin); develops >6h after SAH; spectrophotometry more sensitive than visual inspection | Present = SAH (sensitivity >95% at 12h-2 weeks post-bleed). Absent = unlikely SAH |
| Protein | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Elevated in SAH | Elevated |
| Glucose | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Usually normal in SAH | Normal |
| Gram stain and culture | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Exclude meningitis (meningeal signs overlap) | No organisms |

**Special Handling:** Xanthochromia sample must be protected from light (wrap tube in foil); centrifuge immediately; spectrophotometry if available (more sensitive than visual inspection).

**Note:** CT within 6h of ictus has near 100% sensitivity. If CT is obtained within 6h and is clearly negative, some guidelines suggest LP may not be needed if CTA is also negative. However, LP remains standard of care for CT-negative thunderclap headache in most institutions.

## 3. TREATMENT

### ⚠️ CRITICAL PRIORITIES
1. Secure the airway (if GCS ≤8)
2. Stabilize blood pressure (SBP <160 until aneurysm secured)
3. Identify and secure the aneurysm (clipping or coiling) as soon as possible (<24h)
4. Prevent and treat vasospasm (nimodipine, euvolemia)
5. Monitor for hydrocephalus (EVD if needed)

## 6. MONITORING PARAMETERS

| Parameter | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Frequency | Target/Threshold | Action if Abnormal |
|-----------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Blood pressure (arterial line) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT | Continuous via arterial line in ICU. Pre-securing: target SBP <160. Post-securing: allow SBP 120-180 (higher if vasospasm treatment) | SBP <160 (unsecured); SBP 120-180 (secured); SBP 180-220 if treating vasospasm | Titrate antihypertensives; vasopressors for vasospasm |
| GCS / Neurologic exam | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT | q1h x 24h; then q2h x 48h; then q4h. Hunt-Hess grade at admission | Stable or improving | If declining: STAT CT (rebleed, hydrocephalus, infarct); TCD; adjust treatment |
| ICP (if EVD in place) | - | - | - | STAT | Continuous; record q1h | ICP <22 mmHg; CPP 60-70 mmHg | Tiered ICP management; CSF drainage; osmotherapy |
| Transcranial Doppler (TCD) | - | STAT | - | STAT | Daily from day 3 through day 14 (vasospasm window); some continue to day 21 | MCA mean velocity <120 cm/s; Lindegaard ratio <3 | If MCA >120: CTA/CTP; clinical correlation. If >200: severe vasospasm — consider induced hypertension +/- endovascular rescue |
| Serum sodium | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | q6h x 72h; then q8-12h | 135-145 mEq/L | If <135: differentiate CSW vs SIADH; treat accordingly. If <120: 3% saline; limit correction <10 mEq/24h |
| Serum magnesium | STAT | ROUTINE | - | STAT | Daily; q12h if repleting | >2.0 mg/dL | Replete with MgSO4 2-4 g IV |
| Temperature | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | q4h (q1h if febrile) | <37.5°C (normothermia) | Central fever (common): cooling; acetaminophen. If >38.3°C: infection workup (cultures, CXR, UA) |

| Troponin / BNP | STAT | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE | Troponin daily x 3; BNP at admission and PRN | Track trend | If rising with new ECG changes or hemodynamic instability: echo; cardiology |

| Fluid balance (I/O) | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | q1h in ICU; q4h shift on floor | Net even to slightly positive; euvolemia | Avoid dehydration (vasospasm risk); avoid overhydration (pulmonary edema) |
| Repeat CT head | - | STAT | - | STAT | At 24h post-admission; with any neurologic change; post-procedure; if new hydrocephalus suspected | Stable hemorrhage; no rebleed; no new infarct; ventricle size | Adjust EVD; surgery; vasospasm treatment |
| Hunt-Hess / WFNS grade | STAT | - | - | - | At admission (prognostic) | Document grade | Goals of care if poor grade |

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Disposition | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Discharge home | Never discharge from ED with confirmed SAH. Discharge from hospital when: aneurysm secured; past vasospasm window (day 14-21); stable neurologic exam; Na stable; able to take oral nimodipine; no EVD dependency; adequate follow-up |
| Admit to Neuro-ICU | ALL confirmed aneurysmal SAH patients; minimum 14-21 days ICU-level monitoring during vasospasm window. Transfer to step-down only after vasospasm window passed |
| Transfer to comprehensive stroke center / Neurovascular center | If no neurosurgery or interventional neuroradiology on-site — TRANSFER IMMEDIATELY. SAH requires tertiary neurovascular services |
| Inpatient rehabilitation | Significant deficits but medically stable; past vasospasm window; able to participate in 3h/day therapy |
| Skilled nursing facility | Cannot tolerate intensive rehab; requires ongoing skilled care |
| Hospice / Comfort care | Devastating SAH (Hunt-Hess V with poor prognostic factors); after appropriate observation period and family discussion |
