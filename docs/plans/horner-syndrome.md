# Horner Syndrome

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** February 9, 2026
**REVISED:** February 9, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Horner Syndrome

**ICD-10:** G90.2 (Horner syndrome), H57.00 (Unspecified anomaly of pupillary function), S15.001A (Injury of carotid artery, initial encounter)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC), 80048 (BMP), 70553 (MRI brain with/without contrast), 70549 (MRA neck), 70547 (MRA head), 70496 (CTA head), 70498 (CTA neck), 71046 (Chest X-ray 2 views), 71260 (CT chest with contrast), 70551 (MRI brain without contrast), 72141 (MRI cervical spine), 72156 (MRI cervical/thoracic with contrast), 92081 (Visual field perimetry), 99213 (Office visit), 85651 (ESR), 86140 (CRP)

**SYNONYMS:** Horner's syndrome, oculosympathetic palsy, oculosympathetic paresis, Bernard-Horner syndrome, Claude Bernard-Horner syndrome, sympathetic chain disruption

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and localization of Horner syndrome in adults and children. Includes pharmacologic confirmation, three-neuron localization (first-order central, second-order preganglionic, third-order postganglionic), and etiology-specific workup. Covers ED evaluation of acute Horner syndrome (emergent — dissection until proven otherwise), inpatient evaluation, and outpatient evaluation of chronic or incidental Horner. This is fundamentally a localization and diagnostic template — treatment depends on the underlying etiology.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Horner syndrome:** Ipsilateral triad of miosis (pupil constriction), ptosis (upper eyelid drooping 1-2 mm), and anhidrosis (absent or reduced sweating — facial distribution depends on lesion level); caused by interruption of the oculosympathetic pathway
- **First-order (central) neuron:** Hypothalamus → ciliospinal center of Budge (C8-T2 in spinal cord); lesions: stroke, demyelination, tumor, syringomyelia
- **Second-order (preganglionic) neuron:** Ciliospinal center → superior cervical ganglion; exits thoracic outlet, courses over lung apex and along carotid sheath; lesions: Pancoast tumor, brachial plexus injury, thoracic surgery, cervical/thoracic trauma
- **Third-order (postganglionic) neuron:** Superior cervical ganglion → travels along internal carotid artery → enters skull → to pupil dilator and Muller muscle; lesions: carotid artery dissection, cavernous sinus pathology, cluster headache, skull base tumor
- **Dilation lag:** In Horner syndrome, the affected pupil dilates more slowly than the normal pupil when lights are dimmed; best observed in first 5 seconds of darkness; diagnostic sign
- **Cocaine test:** Topical cocaine 4-10% (or apraclonidine 0.5-1%) — cocaine blocks NE reuptake; Horner pupil fails to dilate (confirms Horner); apraclonidine reversal: Horner pupil dilates due to denervation supersensitivity, normal pupil no change
- **Hydroxyamphetamine test:** Hydroxyamphetamine 1% (Paredrine) — releases NE from intact postganglionic terminals; positive (pupil dilates) = first or second-order lesion; negative (fails to dilate) = third-order (postganglionic) lesion

---

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

---

## CLINICAL URGENCY

**Acute-onset Horner syndrome with pain = CAROTID/VERTEBRAL DISSECTION UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE**

- New Horner syndrome with ipsilateral head, face, or neck pain → emergent vascular imaging (CTA or MRA head/neck) within 1 hour
- Do NOT delay imaging for pharmacologic testing
- Other emergencies: Horner + new stroke symptoms; Horner + Pancoast tumor symptoms (arm pain, wasting)

## 3. TREATMENT

Treatment of Horner syndrome targets the underlying etiology. There is no specific treatment for the Horner syndrome itself (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis are generally mild and cosmetically tolerable).

## 4. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS

### 4A. Referrals & Consults

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Neurology (emergent) for acute painful Horner syndrome — evaluate for dissection, stroke, and initiate acute management | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Neuro-ophthalmology for pharmacologic confirmation (apraclonidine/hydroxyamphetamine testing), pupil assessment, and chronic Horner evaluation | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Vascular surgery/interventional neurology if carotid dissection with pseudoaneurysm or flow-limiting stenosis requiring intervention | - | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE |
| Thoracic surgery/oncology if Pancoast tumor identified; staging and treatment planning | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Ophthalmology for children with congenital Horner — evaluate for iris heterochromia and amblyopia; monitor for neuroblastoma | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Pediatrics/pediatric oncology if Horner in child <2 years — neuroblastoma must be excluded (chest/abdomen imaging, urine catecholamines) | - | STAT | ROUTINE | - |

### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Seek immediate emergency care if you develop sudden severe headache, neck pain, face pain, weakness or numbness on one side, trouble speaking, or vision loss — these could indicate stroke from carotid dissection | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| The droopy eyelid and small pupil are caused by nerve damage to the sympathetic chain — in most cases the cosmetic effect is mild and does not affect vision | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| If the underlying cause is treated (e.g., dissection resolves), the Horner syndrome may partially or fully resolve over weeks to months, though permanent mild ptosis/miosis may persist | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Attend all follow-up imaging appointments — dissections require repeat imaging at 3-6 months to confirm healing; tumors require staging and monitoring | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Do not take blood thinners or aspirin without medical guidance — if you are on anticoagulation for dissection, follow dosing instructions precisely and report any bleeding immediately | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| If cervical artery dissection: avoid neck manipulation (chiropractic), extreme neck extension/rotation, and contact sports until dissection is confirmed healed on repeat imaging (typically 3-6 months) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Optimize cardiovascular risk factors if dissection-related (BP control, cholesterol management, smoking cessation) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Protect the eye on the affected side: ptosis may reduce natural eye protection; use lubricating drops if dryness develops; annual ophthalmologic exam | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Physiologic anisocoria | Difference in pupil size is <1 mm and constant in light and dark; no ptosis; no anhidrosis; present since birth in ~20% of population | Pupil difference constant in all lighting conditions; no dilation lag; pharmacologic testing negative |
| Third nerve palsy (partial) | Ptosis (more severe, often >2 mm); pupil DILATED (not constricted); extraocular movement deficit (especially adduction, elevation, depression) | Complete neuro-ophthalmologic exam; pupil is large (not small); MRI/MRA for aneurysm |
| Adie tonic pupil | Large (dilated) tonic pupil, not miotic; sluggish light reaction with vermiform movements; may have absent DTRs | Dilute pilocarpine 0.1% (supersensitive constriction); slit lamp showing vermiform movements; pupil is larger, not smaller |
| Mechanical ptosis (dermatochalasis, myasthenia) | Ptosis without miosis or anhidrosis; may be bilateral; fluctuating in myasthenia; dermatochalasis is redundant skin | Normal pupils; ice pack test or acetylcholine receptor antibodies for MG; dermatochalasis — skin exam |
| Cluster headache (during attack) | Horner syndrome occurs during cluster attacks (ipsilateral ptosis, miosis); autonomic features (tearing, rhinorrhea, conjunctival injection); resolves between attacks | Clinical history; Horner resolves between cluster periods; MRI normal |
| Carotid artery dissection | Most important cause to exclude; acute Horner + ipsilateral head/neck/face pain; may have partial Horner | CTA/MRA neck showing dissection; fat-suppressed MRI showing intramural hematoma |
| Pancoast tumor | Second-order Horner; arm pain (C8-T1 distribution); hand weakness/wasting; may have shoulder pain | Chest X-ray (apical mass); CT chest with contrast; tissue biopsy |
| Wallenberg syndrome (lateral medullary stroke) | First-order Horner; ipsilateral facial pain/numbness; contralateral body pain/temperature loss; ataxia; dysphagia; vertigo | MRI brain (DWI showing lateral medullary infarct); MRA showing PICA or vertebral occlusion |
| Congenital Horner syndrome | Present since birth; iris heterochromia (affected iris lighter); no new symptoms | Birth history; iris color difference; old photographs; workup to exclude neuroblastoma in children |

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Disposition | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Discharge from ED | Acute Horner with NEGATIVE vascular imaging (no dissection); no stroke; benign etiology suspected; neurology/neuro-ophthalmology follow-up within 1-2 weeks; outpatient MRI if not yet obtained |
| Observation | Awaiting MRI/MRA results; borderline imaging findings requiring vascular surgery input; new Horner without pain — may warrant brief observation while imaging completed |
| Admit to floor | Confirmed carotid/vertebral dissection (anticoagulation initiation, serial neuro exams); stroke associated with dissection; Pancoast tumor workup; new neurologic deficits with Horner |
| Admit to ICU | Acute dissection with large stroke; dissection with progressive neurologic deficit; hemorrhagic conversion of dissection-related stroke; hemodynamic instability |
| Outpatient follow-up (neurology/neuro-ophthalmology) | Chronic/incidental Horner: within 2-4 weeks for pharmacologic testing and localization; post-dissection: 2 weeks (clinical), 3-6 months (repeat imaging); pediatric: urgent if <2 years (neuroblastoma exclusion) |

## NOTES

- Horner syndrome is a LOCALIZATION diagnosis, not a final diagnosis — always identify the underlying cause
- The single most important question: Is this acute and painful? If yes → emergent vascular imaging for dissection
- Carotid dissection is the most dangerous and treatable cause of acute third-order Horner syndrome; it accounts for ~35% of third-order Horner cases
- Classic Horner triad: miosis (1-2 mm smaller than normal eye), ptosis (1-2 mm, mild — unlike CN III which is severe), and anhidrosis (distribution depends on lesion level)
- Dilation lag is the most specific clinical sign: in dim light, the Horner pupil dilates more slowly than the normal pupil; best seen in first 4-5 seconds after lights dim
- Apraclonidine has largely replaced cocaine for pharmacologic confirmation due to availability and ease of use; reversal sign (Horner pupil dilates, normal pupil no change or slight constriction) is diagnostic
- In the ED: do NOT delay vascular imaging to perform pharmacologic pupil testing — if clinical suspicion is high, image first
- Pancoast tumor should be suspected with second-order Horner + lower brachial plexopathy (C8-T1) + arm/shoulder pain; always get a chest X-ray on every Horner patient
- In children under 2 years, congenital Horner requires neuroblastoma exclusion (urine catecholamines, chest/abdomen imaging, possibly MIBG scan)
- Benign/idiopathic Horner exists but is a diagnosis of exclusion after thorough workup
- The Horner syndrome itself (mild ptosis, miosis) is usually cosmetically tolerable and rarely requires treatment; if ptosis is bothersome, Muller muscle-conjunctival resection can be performed
