## 3. TREATMENT

### 3A. First-Line (Benzodiazepine Trial / Urgent Treatment)

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Lorazepam IV (diagnostic and therapeutic benzodiazepine trial) | IV | First-line for NCSE; serves as diagnostic AND therapeutic trial (clinical AND EEG improvement confirms NCSE) | 0.1 mg/kg :: IV :: once :: 0.1 mg/kg IV push over 2 min (max 4 mg/dose); may repeat x1 in 5 min if no response; observe EEG during and after administration | Respiratory depression; acute narrow-angle glaucoma; severe respiratory failure without ventilator | Respiratory rate; O2 sat; EEG response (look for seizure termination AND clinical improvement -- EEG improvement alone without clinical improvement does not confirm NCSE); have airway equipment ready | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Midazolam IM (if no IV access) | IM | No IV access; rapid administration needed | 10 mg :: IM :: once :: 10 mg IM (adults >40 kg) or 0.2 mg/kg intranasal/buccal | Same as lorazepam | Same as lorazepam | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |

*Note: The BENZODIAZEPINE TRIAL is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Administer lorazepam while monitoring EEG. NCSE is confirmed if: (1) electrographic seizure activity resolves AND (2) clinical improvement occurs (improved consciousness, orientation, behavior). IMPORTANT: If EEG improves but clinical status does not, consider alternative diagnoses (postictal state, encephalopathy with EEG patterns that are NOT seizures). Periodic discharges that resolve with benzodiazepines but without clinical improvement are NOT NCSE. Over-treatment of periodic patterns as NCSE in critically ill patients is a common error.*

### 3B. Second-Line Anti-Seizure Medications (Urgent Loading)

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Levetiracetam IV | IV | Second-line; fewest drug interactions; renal dosing simple | 60 mg/kg (max 4500 mg) :: IV :: once :: 60 mg/kg IV (max 4500 mg) infused over 15 min; then maintenance 1000-1500 mg IV/PO BID | Renal impairment (adjust dose per CrCl) | EEG; behavioral changes (rage, agitation); suicidality; renal function | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Fosphenytoin IV | IV | Second-line; preferred if cardiac monitoring available | 20 mg PE/kg :: IV :: once :: 20 mg PE/kg IV (max rate 150 mg PE/min); then maintenance 5-7 mg/kg/day divided BID-TID (target level 10-20 mcg/mL) | AV block; bradycardia; concurrent delavirdine | Continuous cardiac monitoring during load; ECG; phenytoin level; purple glove syndrome (peripheral IV) | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Valproic acid IV | IV | Second-line; broad-spectrum; useful if seizure type unknown | 40 mg/kg :: IV :: once :: 40 mg/kg IV (max rate 10 mg/kg/min); then maintenance 250-500 mg IV q8h (target level 50-100 mcg/mL) | Pregnancy (Category X); hepatic disease; urea cycle disorders; mitochondrial disease (POLG); pancreatitis | LFTs; ammonia; CBC (thrombocytopenia); VPA level; pancreatitis; do NOT use in suspected mitochondrial disease | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Lacosamide IV | IV | Second-line; favorable hemodynamic profile; fewer drug interactions | 200-400 mg :: IV :: once :: Load: 200-400 mg IV over 15 min; maintenance: 100-200 mg IV/PO BID (max 400 mg/day) | Second/third degree AV block; severe hepatic impairment | ECG (PR interval prolongation); dizziness; cardiac monitoring during load | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Phenobarbital IV | IV | Second-line if other agents fail; potent GABAergic | 15-20 mg/kg :: IV :: once :: 15-20 mg/kg IV (max rate 60 mg/min); additional 5-10 mg/kg if needed; maintenance: 1-3 mg/kg/day (target level 15-40 mcg/mL) | Severe respiratory depression; porphyria; hepatic failure | Respiratory depression; sedation; hypotension; drug level; intubation may be needed | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |

*Note: Choose second-line agent based on clinical context: levetiracetam (fewest interactions, renal dosing); fosphenytoin (fast-acting, reliable); valproic acid (broad-spectrum, avoid in pregnancy/liver disease/mitochondrial); lacosamide (favorable hemodynamics). ESTABLISHED SEIZURE EMERGENCY trial and ESETT trial support equivalent efficacy of levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, and valproic acid for benzodiazepine-refractory SE.*

### 3C. Third-Line (Refractory NCSE -- Anesthetic Infusions)

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Midazolam infusion | IV | Refractory NCSE failing 2+ ASMs; requires intubation/ICU | 0.2 mg/kg :: IV :: bolus then continuous :: Bolus: 0.2 mg/kg IV; Infusion: start 0.1 mg/kg/hr; titrate to EEG seizure suppression or burst suppression; max 2 mg/kg/hr; weaning trials q24-48h | Unprotected airway (requires intubation) | Continuous EEG; respiratory status; hemodynamics; sedation depth; tachyphylaxis (may need escalating doses) | - | - | - | STAT |
| Propofol infusion | IV | Refractory NCSE; rapid onset; requires intubation/ICU | 1 mg/kg :: IV :: bolus then continuous :: Bolus: 1-2 mg/kg IV; Infusion: 20-80 mcg/kg/min; max 5 mg/kg/hr (higher doses increase PRIS risk); wean q24-48h | Propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) risk at high doses/prolonged use; egg/soy allergy | Continuous EEG; triglycerides q48h; CPK; lactate; hemodynamics; PRIS surveillance (metabolic acidosis + rhabdomyolysis + cardiac failure + lipemia) | - | - | - | STAT |
| Pentobarbital infusion | IV | Super-refractory NCSE failing midazolam and propofol | 5 mg/kg :: IV :: bolus then continuous :: Loading: 5-15 mg/kg IV (max rate 50 mg/min); Infusion: 0.5-5 mg/kg/hr; titrate to EEG burst suppression; very prolonged recovery; paralytic ileus common | Severe hemodynamic instability without vasopressor support; porphyria | Continuous EEG; hemodynamics (vasopressors usually needed); drug level; temperature (hypothermia); ileus; immunosuppression (prolonged use) | - | - | - | STAT |
| Ketamine infusion | IV | Super-refractory NCSE; NMDA receptor antagonist (different mechanism); may add to midazolam/propofol | 1 mg/kg :: IV :: bolus then continuous :: Bolus: 1-3 mg/kg IV; Infusion: 0.5-5 mg/kg/hr; does not require intubation at lower doses | Uncontrolled hypertension; raised ICP (relative); acute psychosis | Continuous EEG; BP; HR; emergence phenomena; hepatic function | - | - | - | STAT |

*Note: Decision to escalate to anesthetic infusions in NCSE requires careful risk-benefit analysis. Unlike convulsive SE, the threshold for coma-inducing therapy is HIGHER in NCSE because the morbidity of intubation, ICU admission, and prolonged coma may exceed the morbidity of ongoing NCSE (especially in elderly or critically ill patients). Consider patient's baseline function, etiology, and goals of care. The Salzburg consensus and ACNS guidelines recommend judicious use of anesthetic coma in NCSE.*

## CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT NOTES

### Salzburg Consensus Criteria for NCSE (2016)

NCSE is diagnosed when EEG shows:

**Primary Criterion:**
- Epileptiform discharges (EDs) >2.5 Hz for ≥10 seconds

**OR if EDs ≤2.5 Hz or rhythmic delta/theta activity (RDA/RTA):**
Secondary criteria (need at least ONE):
1. EEG AND clinical improvement after IV benzodiazepine
2. Subtle clinical ictal phenomena (e.g., eye deviation, nystagmus, subtle twitching)
3. Spatial/temporal evolution typical of seizures

**IMPORTANT:** Periodic discharges without evolution, fluctuation, or clinical correlate are on the IIC (ictal-interictal continuum) and do NOT automatically equal NCSE.

### When to Suspect NCSE

- [ ] Unexplained altered consciousness or confusion (especially after convulsive seizure)
- [ ] Unexplained coma in ICU patient
- [ ] Post-cardiac arrest with persistent coma
- [ ] Acute brain injury (stroke, TBI, SAH) with fluctuating or worsening consciousness
- [ ] Subtle motor phenomena: eyelid fluttering, nystagmus, facial twitching, lip smacking
- [ ] "Prolonged postictal state" (>30-60 min confusion after witnessed seizure)
- [ ] Known epilepsy with unexplained change in behavior or cognition
- [ ] Encephalopathy with no clear metabolic/toxic etiology
- [ ] Sudden behavioral arrest with unresponsiveness

### Treatment Escalation Decision in NCSE

```
Confirmed NCSE on EEG
  ↓
Step 1: Benzodiazepine (lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV)
  ↓ (If fails)
Step 2: Second-line ASM (LEV, PHT, or VPA IV loading)
  ↓ (If fails)
Step 3: DECISION POINT -- Risk-benefit analysis:
  • Patient factors: age, baseline function, comorbidities, prognosis
  • NCSE type: focal vs generalized; subtle SE vs absence SE
  • Etiology: reversible vs irreversible cause
  ↓
Option A: Continue aggressive IV ASMs (additional second-line agents)
Option B: Escalate to anesthetic infusion (midazolam, propofol)
Option C: Goals-of-care discussion (super-refractory, poor prognosis)
```

### NCSE Classification

| Type | Clinical Features | EEG | Treatment Urgency |
|------|-------------------|-----|-------------------|
| Subtle SE (post-convulsive) | Persistent coma after convulsive SE; subtle movements | Evolving seizure patterns | HIGH -- treat as SE |
| Absence SE | Confusion; staring; responsive but slow; preserved ambulation | Generalized 2-4 Hz spike-wave | MODERATE -- usually responds to benzodiazepines |
| Focal NCSE with impaired awareness | Confusion; automatisms; behavioral change; focal features | Focal seizure activity | MODERATE-HIGH |
| NCSE in critically ill (ICU) | Unexplained coma; subtle movements; post-cardiac arrest | Variable patterns; periodic discharges on IIC | Context-dependent |
| NORSE/FIRES | New-onset refractory; no known cause; often autoimmune | Multifocal or generalized seizures | HIGH -- immunotherapy |
