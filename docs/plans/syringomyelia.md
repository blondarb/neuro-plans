## APPENDIX A: Syringomyelia Classification by Etiology

| Type | Etiology | Mechanism | Typical Imaging Findings | Primary Surgical Treatment |
|------|----------|-----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Type I: Communicating** | Chiari I malformation (most common) | CSF flow obstruction at foramen magnum; tonsillar herniation creates pressure differential driving CSF into central canal | Cerebellar tonsillar ectopia >5 mm; syrinx typically cervical or cervicothoracic; CSF flow obstruction on cine-MRI | Posterior fossa decompression +/- duraplasty |
| **Type II: Post-traumatic** | Spinal cord injury | Arachnoiditis and tethering at injury site; CSF flow obstruction; cord ischemia | Syrinx at or above level of prior injury; cord tethering; arachnoid adhesions | Arachnolysis; syringosubarachnoid shunt; untethering |
| **Type III: Tumor-associated** | Intramedullary tumor (ependymoma, hemangioblastoma, astrocytoma) | Tumor secretion of fluid; obstruction of central canal; peritumoral edema | Enhancing intramedullary mass with rostral and/or caudal syrinx; tumor "caps" at syrinx poles (ependymoma) | Tumor resection (syrinx typically resolves) |
| **Type IV: Post-inflammatory** | Meningitis, arachnoiditis, post-surgical | Arachnoid scarring obstructs CSF flow; tethering of cord | Arachnoid enhancement; loculated CSF; cord tethering; variable syrinx location | Arachnolysis; shunting; duraplasty |
| **Type V: Tethered cord-associated** | Occult spinal dysraphism, thick filum terminale | Cord traction alters CSF dynamics; creates pressure differential | Low-lying conus (<L2); thickened filum (>2 mm); syrinx in thoracolumbar region | Untethering (filum section) |
| **Type VI: Idiopathic** | No identifiable cause | Unknown; possibly related to undetected arachnoiditis or subtle CSF flow abnormality | Isolated syrinx without Chiari, tumor, trauma, or tethering; thorough workup negative | Observation if stable; shunting if progressive |

## APPENDIX B: Surgical Decision Algorithm

| Clinical Scenario | First-Line Surgery | If Syrinx Persists/Recurs |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Chiari I + syrinx, progressive symptoms | Posterior fossa decompression + duraplasty | Revision decompression; consider syringosubarachnoid shunt |
| Chiari I + syrinx, stable/asymptomatic | Observation with serial MRI q6-12 months | Surgery if clinical or radiographic progression |
| Post-traumatic syrinx, progressive | Arachnolysis + untethering at injury site | Syringosubarachnoid or syringopleural shunt |
| Tumor-associated syrinx | Tumor resection (syrinx usually resolves) | If syrinx persists: syringosubarachnoid shunt |
| Post-inflammatory/arachnoiditis syrinx | Arachnolysis + duraplasty if focal adhesions | Syringopleural or syringoperitoneal shunt if diffuse |
| Tethered cord + syrinx | Untethering (filum section) | Syringosubarachnoid shunt if syrinx persists |
| Idiopathic syrinx, progressive | Syringosubarachnoid shunt | Syringopleural shunt; consider re-investigation for etiology |
| Idiopathic syrinx, stable | Observation with serial MRI q6-12 months | Surgery only if clinical progression develops |

**Key Surgical Principles:**
- Always treat the underlying cause first (Chiari decompression, tumor resection, untethering) before shunting
- Shunting is reserved for cases that fail primary treatment or when no treatable cause is identified
- Serial MRI at 3-6 months post-surgery is essential to assess response
- Revision surgery may be needed in 10-20% of cases due to re-tethering, shunt malfunction, or recurrent obstruction
- Stable, asymptomatic syrinxes found incidentally do not require surgery; observation with serial imaging is appropriate
