  "scope": "** Diagnosis, acute management, and long-term treatment of psychogenic non-epileptic spells (PNES). Covers the diagnostic workup including video-EEG confirmation, semiology features distinguishing PNES from epileptic seizures, diagnosis delivery as a therapeutic intervention, psychotherapy (CBT as evidence-based treatment), management of psychiatric comorbidities (PTSD, depression, anxiety), and anti-seizure medication taper. Addresses the ~10% of PNES patients with comorbid epilepsy. Settings: ED (acute event management), HOSP (video-EEG monitoring and diagnosis), OPD (long-term therapy and follow-up). ICU is generally NOT applicable for PNES. For epileptic seizures, see \"New Onset Seizure\" and \"Status Epilepticus\" templates. For the broader category of functional neurological disorder, see \"FND\" template.",
