### LUMBAR PUNCTURE

**Indication:** Primary diagnostic tool for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis; CSF cytology, flow cytometry, cell-free DNA; also therapeutic (IT chemotherapy administration)
**Timing:** URGENT at initial presentation if LMD suspected; repeat LP if first cytology negative (sensitivity improves from ~50% to ~80-90% with repeat)
**Volume Required:** 10-15 mL minimum (larger volumes improve cytology yield); collect from last tube for cytology to minimize traumatic contamination

| Study | Rationale | Target Finding | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-------|-----------|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Opening pressure (CPT 89050) | Elevated ICP common in LMD (30-50% of patients); communicating hydrocephalus assessment; guides need for CSF diversion | 10-20 cm H2O normal; >25 cm H2O elevated; >30 cm H2O consider urgent CSF diversion | URGENT | URGENT | ROUTINE | URGENT |

| CSF glucose (CPT 82945) | Low CSF glucose (hypoglycorrhachia) present in ~40-60% of LMD; calculate CSF:serum ratio | Normal CSF glucose >40 mg/dL (or >60% of serum); low CSF glucose (<40 or CSF:serum <0.5) supports LMD diagnosis | URGENT | URGENT | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| CSF cell count with differential (CPT 89051) | Lymphocytic pleocytosis in 40-70% of LMD; distinguish from infectious meningitis; atypical cells on differential | WBC <5 normal; elevated WBC with lymphocytic predominance supports LMD; atypical or malignant cells on differential | URGENT | URGENT | ROUTINE | URGENT |

**Special Handling:** CSF cytology specimens MUST be processed within 30 minutes of collection (cells degrade rapidly at room temperature); send immediately to cytopathology on ice or in fixative per institutional protocol; last tube typically used for cytology to minimize blood contamination; if flow cytometry ordered, send in separate tube without fixative
**Contraindications:** Significant mass effect with midline shift >5mm; obstructive hydrocephalus (herniation risk); large posterior fossa mass; coagulopathy (INR >1.5 or platelets <50,000); skin infection at LP site; anticoagulation (hold per guidelines before LP)

## APPENDIX B: Ommaya Reservoir Management

### Pre-Access Checklist

| Step | Details |
|------|---------|
| Verify reservoir patency | Palpate for subcutaneous dome; assess for erythema, warmth, tenderness |
| Sterile preparation | Strict aseptic technique; shave site if needed; chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine prep |
| Butterfly needle | 25-gauge butterfly needle; attach to syringe; insert perpendicular through dome |
| Aspirate CSF | Withdraw 3-5 mL CSF (send for cytology, cell count, protein, culture if indicated) |
| Inject medication | Inject IT chemotherapy slowly (over 2-3 minutes) in preservative-free saline |
| Flush | Flush with 2-3 mL preservative-free normal saline |
| Post-procedure | Patient lies flat for 15-30 min; monitor for 1-2 hours; assess for headache, nausea |

### Complications of Ommaya Reservoir

| Complication | Frequency | Management |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Infection (bacterial) | 5-10% | CSF cultures from reservoir; empiric vancomycin + cefepime; if confirmed, reservoir removal usually required |
| Malposition/migration | 3-5% | CT head to confirm catheter tip position; neurosurgery for revision if malpositioned |
| Hemorrhage (at insertion) | 1-3% | Post-op CT; neurosurgical management if symptomatic |
| CSF leak | 1-3% | Pressure dressing; head elevation; neurosurgery if persistent |
| Chemical meningitis (from IT chemo) | 20-40% | Dexamethasone prophylaxis (especially with liposomal cytarabine); supportive care; self-limited 24-72h |
| Leukoencephalopathy | 5-15% (cumulative) | MRI surveillance; dose reduction or discontinuation of IT chemo; steroids; no specific treatment |
| Catheter obstruction | 5-10% | Unable to aspirate CSF; CT to check position; reservoir tap under fluoroscopy; may need revision |

## APPENDIX C: CSF Diagnostic Sensitivity Comparison

| Diagnostic Test | Sensitivity (single sample) | Sensitivity (repeat/combined) | Specificity | Notes |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|-------|
| CSF cytology | ~50% | ~80-90% (2-3 samples) | ~100% (if malignant cells identified) | Gold standard; must process within 30 min; large volume improves yield (>10 mL) |
| CSF flow cytometry | ~75-90% (hematologic malignancies) | ~95% | ~95-100% | Best for lymphoma/leukemia; identifies clonal populations; less useful for solid tumors |
| CSF cell-free DNA (cfDNA) | ~80-90% | N/A | ~95-100% | Emerging; can identify mutations; monitor treatment response; may detect LMD before cytology positive |
| MRI (gadolinium-enhanced) | ~70-80% | ~85% (with 3D FLAIR) | ~85-90% | False positives from infection, inflammation, prior procedures; sensitivity depends on technique |
| CSF protein elevation | ~80% (>50 mg/dL) | N/A | ~50% (nonspecific) | Supportive finding only; not diagnostic alone |
| CSF glucose depression | ~40-60% | N/A | ~70% (nonspecific) | Suggestive but seen in infection also |
| CSF tumor markers | ~60-80% (varies by marker) | N/A | ~80-90% | Best when correlated with serum; CSF:serum ratio >1 suggests intrathecal production |
