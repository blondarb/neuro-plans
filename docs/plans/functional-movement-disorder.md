## 1. LABORATORY WORKUP

### 1A. Essential/Core Labs

| Test | Rationale | Target Finding | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|------|-----------|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| CBC with differential (CPT 85025) | Baseline; rule out infection or systemic illness as contributor to neurological symptoms | Normal | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| CMP (BMP + LFTs) (CPT 80053) | Metabolic encephalopathy screen; electrolyte derangement as mimic; hepatic dysfunction (Wilson disease screening) | Normal | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| TSH (CPT 84443) | Thyroid dysfunction as contributor to tremor, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric symptoms | Normal | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| Blood glucose (CPT 82947) | Hypoglycemia as mimic of acute neurological symptoms | Normal | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| ESR (CPT 85652) | Inflammatory or autoimmune screen when systemic disease suspected | Normal | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| CRP (CPT 86140) | Inflammatory screen; elevated in systemic inflammatory conditions mimicking movement disorder | Normal | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| Urinalysis (CPT 81003) | UTI screen (delirium/encephalopathy mimic); drug screen component | Normal | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |

*Note: Laboratory testing in FMD is NOT for diagnosis (FMD is a positive clinical diagnosis based on examination signs) but to rule out metabolic/systemic contributors and to provide documentation for patient reassurance. Avoid reflexive over-investigation which reinforces illness behavior and delays treatment.*

### 1B. Extended Workup (Context-Dependent)

| Test | Rationale | Target Finding | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|------|-----------|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Ceruloplasmin (CPT 82390) | Wilson disease screen if young-onset (<50 years) movement disorder; especially if dystonia or tremor | Normal (20-35 mg/dL) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| 24-hour urine copper (CPT 82525) | Confirmatory for Wilson disease if ceruloplasmin borderline or low | Normal (<40 mcg/24hr) | - | EXT | EXT | - |
| Vitamin B12 (CPT 82607) | B12 deficiency neuropathy or myelopathy as comorbidity contributing to gait dysfunction | Normal | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Vitamin D 25-OH (CPT 82306) | Deficiency associated with chronic pain and fatigue, common FMD comorbidities | Normal (>30 ng/mL) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Urine drug screen (CPT 80307) | Substance-related movement disorder mimic; psychiatric differential | Negative | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| ANA (CPT 86235) | Autoimmune screen if features suggest SLE or other connective tissue disease | Negative | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

| HbA1c (CPT 83036) | Diabetic neuropathy comorbidity contributing to gait difficulty | Normal (<5.7%) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

*Note: Extended labs should be guided by clinical suspicion for organic comorbid conditions. A negative workup does NOT diagnose FMD -- FMD is diagnosed by POSITIVE clinical signs on examination.*

### 1C. Rare/Specialized

| Test | Rationale | Target Finding | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|------|-----------|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Genetic testing for hereditary dystonia (DYT genes: DYT1/TOR1A, DYT6/THAP1, DYT11/SGCE) | If functional dystonia features overlap with hereditary dystonia in young patients | Negative | - | - | EXT | - |

## 2. DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING & STUDIES

### 2A. Essential/First-line

| Study | Timing | Target Finding | Contraindications | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-------|--------|----------------|-------------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| MRI brain with and without contrast (CPT 70553) | Within 1-2 weeks; URGENT if acute stroke concern | Normal; rules out structural pathology (basal ganglia lesion, demyelination, mass); provides reassurance data | Standard MRI contraindications | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| CT head without contrast (CPT 70450) | ED triage if acute presentation or head trauma | Rule out hemorrhage, mass, acute hydrocephalus | None significant | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |

*Note: MRI brain is primarily to rule out structural pathology and to provide objective documentation for the patient. For FMD, diagnosis rests on positive clinical signs (entrainment, distractibility, Hoover sign, etc.), NOT on imaging findings. Surface EMG with accelerometry provides objective electrophysiologic confirmation of functional tremor and can be shown to the patient as part of diagnosis delivery.*

### 2B. Extended

| Study | Timing | Target Finding | Contraindications | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-------|--------|----------------|-------------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| DaTscan (dopamine transporter SPECT) (CPT 78607) | If differentiating functional parkinsonism from neurodegenerative parkinsonism | Normal uptake in functional parkinsonism; reduced uptake in Parkinson disease, MSA, PSP | None significant | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| EMG/NCS (electromyography/nerve conduction studies) (CPT 95907-95913) | If peripheral neuropathy or myopathy suspected as comorbidity; helps differentiate organic from functional weakness | Normal or shows functional patterns (inconsistent recruitment, give-way pattern); rules out neuropathy/myopathy | None significant | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| MRI spine (cervical/thoracic) (CPT 72141/72146) | If myelopathy symptoms or upper motor neuron signs on examination suggest spinal cord pathology | Normal (rules out structural myelopathy) | Standard MRI contraindications | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Jerk-locked back-averaging (EEG-EMG polygraphy) | If functional myoclonus suspected; differentiates cortical from functional myoclonus | No pre-movement cortical potential (Bereitschaftspotential) in functional myoclonus; positive Bereitschaftspotential suggests functional origin; cortical correlate present in cortical myoclonus | None significant | - | EXT | EXT | - |
| Long-latency reflex testing | If myoclonus evaluation; functional vs cortical vs subcortical differentiation | Absent cortical reflex response supports functional myoclonus | None significant | - | EXT | EXT | - |
| Video-EEG monitoring (CPT 95711-95720) | If comorbid functional seizures suspected alongside movement disorder | Normal EEG during typical event confirms functional origin | None significant | - | URGENT | ROUTINE | URGENT |

### 2C. Rare/Specialized

## 3. TREATMENT

### 3A. Acute/Emergent

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Verbal de-escalation and reassurance (first-line acute management) | - | Acute functional movement event (severe tremor, dystonic episode, functional gait failure, functional jerks) in ED or inpatient | N/A :: - :: - :: Use calm, reassuring voice; "I can see your body is doing something involuntary -- I'm going to help you"; grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1 sensory grounding); do NOT restrain; do NOT use forceful commands | None | Event duration; response to verbal cues; vital signs; injury assessment | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Distraction-based movement normalization | - | Functional tremor, dystonia, or gait failure during acute presentation; can rapidly demonstrate diagnosis | N/A :: - :: - :: Ask patient to perform contralateral rhythmic tapping (tremor entrainment test); ask patient to walk backward (gait improvement = positive sign); use cognitive loading (serial 7s, word generation) during movement testing | None | Observe for movement normalization with distraction; document positive signs | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Avoid unnecessary sedation | - | Do NOT sedate patients with functional movement events; sedation delays diagnosis and causes iatrogenic harm | N/A :: - :: - :: Withhold IV benzodiazepines, haloperidol, or propofol for functional movement events unless diagnostic uncertainty requires emergent treatment of possible organic movement disorder emergency (e.g., status dystonicus) | If organic movement disorder emergency cannot be excluded, treat as organic | Respiratory status; mental status; document clinical features | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Lorazepam (ONLY if organic movement disorder emergency cannot be excluded) | IV | Status dystonicus or acute dystonic reaction cannot be excluded; diagnostic uncertainty | 1 mg :: IV :: PRN :: 1-2 mg IV push; may repeat x1 in 10 min; max 4 mg; ONLY if organic dystonic emergency suspected; discontinue once functional diagnosis confirmed | Respiratory depression; severe COPD without ventilatory support | Respiratory status; sedation level; response | URGENT | URGENT | - | URGENT |
| Diphenhydramine (ONLY if acute dystonic reaction suspected) | IV/IM | Acute dystonic reaction from neuroleptic cannot be excluded as cause | 50 mg :: IV :: single dose :: 50 mg IV/IM x1; response within 15-30 min confirms drug-induced dystonic reaction; if no response, reassess diagnosis | Narrow-angle glaucoma; urinary retention | Response to treatment; anticholinergic effects; sedation | URGENT | URGENT | - | URGENT |

*Note: CRITICAL -- Most functional movement episodes do NOT require pharmacologic treatment. The most effective acute intervention is recognizing the functional nature of the movement disorder and using distraction/grounding techniques. Unnecessary sedation or antipsychotic administration causes iatrogenic harm and delays appropriate treatment. Only use pharmacotherapy when organic movement disorder emergency (status dystonicus, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, acute dystonic reaction) cannot be excluded.*

### 3B. Diagnosis Delivery and Communication (Core Therapeutic Intervention)

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Structured diagnosis delivery session | - | All FMD patients; THE single most important therapeutic intervention for functional movement disorder | N/A :: - :: - :: Explain FMD as a REAL neurological condition; the nervous system is sending wrong movement signals ("software problem, not hardware"); SHOW the patient their positive signs (entrainment, Hoover sign, distractibility) as EVIDENCE; express confidence in diagnosis; emphasize treatability; direct to www.neurosymptoms.org; allow time for questions | None | Patient understanding; emotional response; acceptance of diagnosis; therapeutic alliance | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Movement-specific positive sign demonstration to patient | - | Functional tremor, dystonia, myoclonus, parkinsonism, or gait disorder with identifiable positive signs on examination | N/A :: - :: - :: For tremor: show patient how tremor changes with contralateral tapping (entrainment); for weakness: demonstrate Hoover sign at bedside; for gait: show improvement with backward walking; for myoclonus: show distractibility of jerks; explain "your brain CAN produce normal movement -- we just saw it" | None | Patient engagement; comprehension; emotional response | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |

*Note: HOW the diagnosis is communicated is the single most important factor in treatment engagement and outcomes. Key principles: (1) Use "Functional Movement Disorder" -- not "psychogenic" or "fake"; (2) Explain it as a problem with HOW the nervous system controls movement, not structural damage; (3) SHOW the patient their positive signs as objective EVIDENCE of the diagnosis (this is unique to FMD -- no other diagnosis lets you demonstrate the mechanism to the patient in real time); (4) Express confidence; (5) Emphasize treatability and good prognosis with therapy; (6) Avoid implying symptoms are fabricated. Direct patients to www.neurosymptoms.org (run by Prof. Jon Stone).*

### 3C. Physical Rehabilitation (Primary Treatment)

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| FMD-specialized physiotherapy (consensus-based approach) | - | Functional motor symptoms (tremor, dystonia, weakness, gait disorder); PRIMARY treatment modality with strongest evidence | Outpatient: 1-2 sessions/week x 12-20 weeks :: - :: - :: Movement retraining using distraction techniques; task-specific training; graded exposure to avoided movements; normalize automatic movement patterns; NOT standard strengthening exercises; requires therapist with FMD/FND training (Nielsen consensus approach) | Active psychosis; complete refusal to engage | Functional outcome measures (timed 25-foot walk, 10-meter walk test, Berg Balance Scale, tremor rating scale); patient engagement; symptom trajectory | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Intensive inpatient FMD rehabilitation program | - | Severe functional disability not improving with outpatient therapy; wheelchair-bound from functional gait disorder; severe functional dystonia limiting ADLs | 2-5 sessions/day x 3-5 weeks :: - :: - :: Intensive multidisciplinary inpatient program with PT, OT, psychology, neurology; consensus-based goal-oriented approach; daily movement retraining with graduated functional challenges | Severe untreated psychiatric comorbidity; active suicidality; complete lack of engagement | Daily functional outcome measures; goal attainment scaling; discharge readiness | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Occupational therapy (FMD-focused) | - | Upper extremity functional symptoms; ADL difficulties; functional hand dystonia; work role adaptation | 1-2 sessions/week :: - :: - :: Functional task retraining; graded activity progression; sensory retraining for functional sensory loss; workplace and home modifications; assistive device assessment (with goal of weaning) | None significant | ADL measures; occupational function; grip strength; dexterity testing | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Gait retraining with biofeedback | - | Functional gait disorder (astasia-abasia, knee buckling, dragging gait); high fall risk | 2-3 sessions/week x 8-12 weeks :: - :: - :: Treadmill-based retraining with mirror or video biofeedback; backward walking exercises; dual-task walking (cognitive loading normalizes gait); progressive challenge escalation | Unable to stand safely; severe cardiovascular instability | Timed 25-foot walk; Berg Balance Scale; fall frequency; gait symmetry measures | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Tremor retraining protocol | - | Functional tremor as primary symptom; persistent disabling tremor | 1-2 sessions/week x 12 weeks :: - :: - :: Voluntary movement retraining using distraction; rhythmic entrainment exercises to regain voluntary control; weighted utensil training; progressive relaxation of affected limb; home exercise program | None significant | Tremor rating scale; functional impact; patient self-report | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

*Note: FMD-specialized physiotherapy is the CORE treatment for functional movement disorders and has the strongest evidence base (Nielsen et al. 2015 RCT; Czarnecki et al. 2012). The approach is fundamentally different from standard neuro rehab: focus is on normalizing AUTOMATIC movement using distraction and task-specific training, NOT on strengthening or compensatory strategies. Standard PT that focuses on impairment may reinforce symptom focus and worsen outcomes. Therapist training in FMD-specific approaches is essential.*

### 3D. Psychological Treatment

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) -- FMD-focused | - | All FMD patients; addresses illness beliefs, symptom attention, avoidance behaviors, perpetuating factors | 12-20 sessions :: - :: - :: Weekly 50-min sessions; FMD-specific CBT model addressing predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors; cognitive restructuring of illness beliefs; behavioral activation; graded exposure to avoided activities | Active psychosis; severe cognitive impairment | Symptom frequency/severity; functional measures; PHQ-9; GAD-7; treatment engagement | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

*Note: There is NO medication that directly treats functional movement disorder. Pharmacotherapy targets COMORBIDITIES (depression, anxiety, chronic pain, insomnia) which are present in the majority of FMD patients and perpetuate the disorder. CRITICAL: Avoid benzodiazepines for ongoing FMD management -- they do not improve functional movements, risk dependence, and may worsen functional neurological symptoms through cognitive/sedative effects. Do NOT prescribe dopaminergic agents, anticholinergics, or botulinum toxin for functional movement disorders (they are ineffective and reinforce an incorrect disease model).*

### 3F. Botulinum Toxin Considerations

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Botulinum toxin (generally NOT recommended for FMD) | IM | NOT first-line for functional dystonia; consider ONLY if severe fixed functional dystonia causing contracture risk AND failing rehabilitation AND concomitant organic dystonia cannot be excluded | Per muscle group :: IM :: q12 weeks :: Specialist decision only; if used, target specific muscles causing contracture risk; limited evidence in functional dystonia; may reinforce biomedical illness model; discuss as adjunct to rehab, not primary treatment | Myasthenia gravis; ALS; pregnancy; infection at injection site | Muscle weakness; dysphagia (cervical injection); functional outcome; treatment engagement with rehabilitation | - | - | EXT | - |

*Note: Botulinum toxin is generally NOT recommended for functional dystonia as it reinforces an incorrect disease model and has limited evidence. Consider ONLY in rare cases where fixed dystonia threatens contracture formation despite maximal rehabilitation, or where organic dystonia cannot be fully excluded. Always as adjunct to, never replacement for, physiotherapy and psychological treatment.*

### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Functional movement disorder is a REAL neurological condition -- your movements are genuine and involuntary, not imagined or "put on" | Y | Y | Y |
| Visit www.neurosymptoms.org for reliable, expert-written information about functional movement disorder (recommended by leading specialists worldwide) | Y | Y | Y |
| FMD is treatable -- many patients improve significantly with specialized physiotherapy and psychological support; early treatment produces best outcomes | Y | Y | Y |
| Your positive clinical signs (tremor entrainment, distractibility, Hoover sign) are EVIDENCE of the diagnosis -- ask your neurologist to demonstrate them to you | - | Y | Y |
| Specialized physiotherapy is the most effective treatment -- attend all sessions and practice home exercises daily for best results | - | Y | Y |
| Avoid excessive medical testing and repeated specialist visits seeking alternative diagnoses; this delays recovery and reinforces symptom focus | - | Y | Y |
| Regular physical activity and graded exercise improve outcomes -- avoid prolonged bed rest or complete activity avoidance | - | Y | Y |
| Stress, poor sleep, and overexertion can temporarily worsen movements -- pace activities and maintain consistent sleep schedule | - | Y | Y |
| Recovery is often gradual with expected setbacks -- a bad day does not mean the diagnosis is wrong or that treatment is failing | - | Y | Y |
| Return to ED for symptoms clearly different from your usual functional movements, such as sudden severe headache, fever, new one-sided weakness with facial droop, or loss of consciousness with injury | Y | Y | Y |
| Do not drive if functional movements or episodes impair safe vehicle operation; discuss driving clearance with your neurologist | - | Y | Y |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Regular aerobic exercise (30 min, 5x/week) to improve mood, reduce pain perception, and support neuroplasticity underlying movement recovery | - | Y | Y |
| Sleep hygiene: consistent bed/wake times 7 days/week, avoid screens 1 hour before bed, limit caffeine after noon to optimize neurological function | - | Y | Y |
| Stress management: daily mindfulness practice, breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or journaling to reduce physiological stress arousal | - | Y | Y |
| Activity pacing to avoid boom-bust cycle (overactivity on good days leading to crash and symptom exacerbation on subsequent days) | - | Y | Y |
| Limit alcohol consumption as it worsens mood, disrupts sleep, and can exacerbate movement symptoms | - | Y | Y |
| Avoid benzodiazepines for functional movement symptoms (ineffective, risk of dependence, may worsen functional neurological symptoms) | - | Y | Y |
| Maintain social connections and meaningful activities -- social isolation is a strong perpetuating factor for FMD | - | Y | Y |
| Graded return to work or educational activities with occupational therapy support to prevent prolonged disability and deconditioning | - | Y | Y |
| Ergonomic assessment of workspace if functional hand tremor or dystonia affects occupational performance | - | - | Y |

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |

## CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT NOTES

### Positive Clinical Signs for Functional Movement Disorder (Diagnosis BY Examination)

**Functional Tremor (Most Common FMD Subtype):**
- **Entrainment**: Tremor frequency shifts to match voluntary rhythmic tapping in contralateral limb (pathognomonic)
- **Distractibility**: Tremor diminishes or stops with cognitive distraction tasks (serial 7s, months backward)
- **Variability**: Amplitude and frequency change significantly over examination period (>1 Hz variation = functional)
- **Pause with contralateral ballistic movement**: Tremor stops momentarily when opposite hand performs sudden movement
- **Co-activation sign**: Tremor onset or increase occurs when examiner passively holds the limb (tonic co-contraction)
- **Whack-a-mole sign**: Tremor moves to a different body part when the affected part is immobilized

**Functional Dystonia:**
- **Fixed posture from onset**: Typically fixed from symptom onset (organic dystonia usually starts mobile/action-induced)
- **Ankle inversion pattern**: Fixed inverted ankle posture (very common in functional dystonia, rare in organic)
- **Active resistance to passive movement**: Resistance that increases with examiner effort (not seen in organic dystonia)
- **Inconsistent posture**: Dystonic posture changes or resolves with distraction
- **Pain at onset**: Severe pain accompanying dystonia onset (organic dystonia is usually painless initially)
- **Absence of sensory geste antagoniste**: No touch trick (present in most organic cervical dystonia)

**Functional Myoclonus:**
- **Variable amplitude and distribution**: Jerks change in intensity and location over examination
- **Stimulus-sensitivity with long latency**: Jerks triggered by stimuli but with inconsistent or prolonged latency
- **Distractibility**: Jerks diminish or cease with distraction tasks
- **Bereitschaftspotential on jerk-locked back-averaging**: Slow cortical potential preceding the jerk indicates voluntary-like movement generation (absent in cortical myoclonus)
- **Entrainability**: Jerk frequency can be entrained to external rhythm

**Functional Parkinsonism:**
- **Normal DaTscan**: Dopamine transporter imaging is normal (abnormal in PD, MSA, PSP)
- **Non-decrementing bradykinesia**: Finger-tapping does not show true decrement; may show effort-dependent slowing
- **Variable rigidity**: Rigidity changes with distraction; paratonia pattern
- **Gait features**: Excessive slowness without shuffling; astasia-abasia; knee buckling
- **Tremor entrainment**: If tremor present, shows features of functional tremor (see above)
- **Absence of non-motor PD features**: No REM sleep behavior disorder; no anosmia; no constipation

**Functional Gait Disorder:**
- **Knee buckling without falling**: Astasia-abasia; patient buckles but catches themselves
- **Excessive slowness**: Disproportionate to examination findings in seated position
- **Dragging monoplegic gait**: Hip externally rotated; foot dragged behind (not circumducted as in UMN)
- **Improvement with distraction**: Gait normalizes with backward walking, tandem walking, or dual-task
- **Chair test**: Patient can stand from chair without difficulty but demonstrates severe gait impairment
- **Huffing and puffing**: Effortful appearance disproportionate to actual energy expenditure

### Electrophysiologic Confirmation of FMD

| Test | FMD Finding | Organic Finding | Applicable Subtype |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Surface EMG tremor analysis | Variable frequency (>1 Hz variation); entrainment with contralateral tapping; pause with ballistic movement | Consistent frequency; no entrainment; no pause | Functional tremor |
| Jerk-locked back-averaging | Bereitschaftspotential present (pre-movement cortical potential) | No Bereitschaftspotential (cortical myoclonus shows cortical correlate) | Functional myoclonus |
| Long-latency reflex testing | Normal or absent cortical reflex response | Enhanced cortical reflex in cortical myoclonus | Functional myoclonus |
| DaTscan (SPECT) | Normal dopamine transporter uptake | Reduced uptake (PD, MSA, PSP) | Functional parkinsonism |
| Accelerometry | Variable amplitude; variable frequency; cross-correlation with contralateral task | Stable frequency; no correlation with contralateral task | Functional tremor |

### Predisposing, Precipitating, and Perpetuating Factors (3Ps Model for FMD)

| Factor Type | Examples |
|-------------|---------|
| **Predisposing** | Childhood adversity/trauma; chronic pain history; prior neurological illness or injury; personality traits (perfectionism, alexithymia); female sex (2:1 F:M); family illness models; prior surgery or physical trauma to affected body part |
| **Precipitating** | Physical injury or surgery (most common trigger for FMD); panic attack; acute stress/life event; medical illness; prolonged immobilization; dissociative episode; observation of another person's movement disorder |
| **Perpetuating** | Illness beliefs ("I have Parkinson's"); avoidance of movement/activity; deconditioning; excessive medical investigation (iatrogenic reinforcement); incorrect prior diagnoses; disability/litigation; family accommodation and overprotection; untreated psychiatric comorbidity (depression, PTSD); catastrophizing |

### What NOT to Do in Functional Movement Disorder

| Harmful Approach | Why It's Harmful | Instead Do |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| "Your movements are psychological" | Implies symptoms are voluntary or fabricated; damages therapeutic alliance | "Your nervous system is sending wrong movement signals -- a software problem" |
| Prescribe levodopa for functional parkinsonism | Ineffective; side effects; reinforces incorrect diagnosis | Confirm with DaTscan; deliver FMD diagnosis; refer to rehabilitation |
| Botulinum toxin as first-line for functional dystonia | Limited evidence; reinforces biomedical model; delays effective treatment | Specialized physiotherapy + psychological treatment first |
| Prescribe benzodiazepines for functional tremor | Ineffective for functional tremor; risk of dependence; cognitive impairment worsens FMD | CBT; physiotherapy; treat underlying anxiety with SSRI/SNRI |
| Excessive imaging and testing | Reinforces illness behavior; delays treatment; iatrogenic anxiety from incidental findings | Targeted testing based on clinical suspicion; use positive signs for diagnosis |
| "Diagnosis of exclusion" approach | Delays diagnosis by months-years; implies doubt; reduces patient confidence | Use positive clinical signs (entrainment, distractibility, Hoover) as evidence |
| "Nothing wrong -- it's just stress" | Invalidating; dismissive; inaccurate | "FMD is a real, recognized neurological condition; stress can be a trigger but is not the whole picture" |
| Referring to psychiatry without explanation | Patient feels dismissed; perceives referral as "you think I'm crazy" | Explain that multidisciplinary treatment (neuro + PT + psych) is standard best-practice care for FMD |
