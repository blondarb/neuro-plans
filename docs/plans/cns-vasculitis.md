**SCOPE:** Diagnosis, immunosuppressive treatment, and long-term monitoring of primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS). Covers the classic triad (headache, cognitive decline, focal deficits), CSF analysis, MRI findings, conventional angiography, brain biopsy indications and limitations, induction immunosuppression (high-dose corticosteroids plus cyclophosphamide), maintenance immunosuppression (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil), and serial monitoring. Includes differentiation from reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), secondary CNS vasculitis (SLE, sarcoidosis, infection-related), and other stroke mimics. For systemic vasculitis with CNS involvement, use the specific systemic vasculitis template. For RCVS, use "RCVS" template if available. For ischemic stroke management, use "Acute Ischemic Stroke" template.

### LUMBAR PUNCTURE

**Indication:** Essential for PACNS evaluation. CSF is abnormal in 80-90% of biopsy-confirmed PACNS cases. Normal CSF argues against PACNS but does not exclude it. Helps exclude infectious, neoplastic, and other inflammatory etiologies.

**Timing:** URGENT after CT head excludes mass effect; do not delay if clinical suspicion is high

**Volume Required:** 15-20 mL (extra for cytology, cultures, autoimmune panel)

| Study | Rationale | Target Finding | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-------|-----------|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Opening pressure | Elevated ICP assessment; pseudotumor mimic | 10-20 cm H2O (may be mildly elevated) | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

| BioFire FilmArray ME Panel (CPT 87483) | Rapid multiplex PCR for common infectious meningitis/encephalitis pathogens | Negative | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | - |
| Beta-D-glucan (CSF) | Fungal CNS infection | Negative | - | EXT | EXT | - |

**Special Handling:** VZV IgG/IgM in CSF requires paired serum sample drawn within 1 hour. Cytology requires rapid transport (<1 hour). Store extra CSF (frozen at -80C) for future testing. CSF cell count may normalize with treatment -- serial LP useful for monitoring.

**Contraindications:** Elevated ICP without imaging (obtain CT first); coagulopathy (INR >1.5, platelets <50K); skin infection at LP site; posterior fossa mass

*Note: High-dose IV methylprednisolone should be initiated as soon as PACNS is strongly suspected clinically, even before biopsy confirmation. However, brain biopsy should be obtained BEFORE starting steroids whenever feasible, as steroids may obscure histopathologic findings. If clinical urgency mandates treatment before biopsy, document rationale. Empiric acyclovir should be given until VZV vasculopathy is excluded, as VZV vasculopathy is the most common infectious mimic.*

*Note: The standard induction regimen for PACNS is high-dose IV corticosteroids followed by oral prednisone taper PLUS cyclophosphamide (IV pulse preferred over oral for lower cumulative toxicity). After 3-6 months of induction, transition to maintenance with azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. The total duration of maintenance therapy is typically 18-24 months minimum, but many patients require extended or indefinite immunosuppression due to 25-30% relapse rate. Monitor closely during steroid taper for clinical relapse.*

## CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT NOTES

### Diagnostic Approach to Suspected PACNS

**Calabrese/Mallek Criteria (1988):**
All three must be met:
- [ ] Acquired and otherwise unexplained neurological deficit
- [ ] Classic angiographic or histopathologic features of angiitis within the CNS
- [ ] No evidence of systemic vasculitis or any condition that could cause the angiographic or pathologic features

**Practical Diagnostic Algorithm:**
1. Clinical suspicion (headache + cognitive decline + focal deficits in a subacute/chronic pattern)
2. MRI brain with contrast + MRA (multifocal infarcts, white matter lesions, enhancement)
3. LP (lymphocytic pleocytosis + elevated protein in 80-90%)
4. Exclude secondary causes (systemic vasculitis, infection, malignancy, RCVS)
5. Conventional angiography with vessel wall imaging
6. Brain biopsy (gold standard) -- especially when angiography is normal or equivocal

### PACNS vs. RCVS: Key Differentiating Features

| Feature | PACNS | RCVS |
|---------|-------|------|
| Headache onset | Gradual, progressive, subacute | Thunderclap (maximal at onset) |
| Course | Progressive without treatment | Self-limited (resolves in 12 weeks) |
| CSF | Abnormal in 80-90% (pleocytosis, elevated protein) | Normal or near-normal |
| Vessel wall imaging | Concentric enhancement (active inflammation) | No wall enhancement or smooth thin enhancement |
| Angiography | Persistent or progressive abnormalities | Vasoconstriction resolves by 12 weeks |
| Age | Any age; median 50s | Younger; median 40s |
| Triggers | None specific | Vasoactive drugs, postpartum, exertion, cannabis |
| Treatment | Long-term immunosuppression | Supportive; calcium channel blockers; avoid triggers |
| Prognosis | Relapsing without treatment; may be fatal | Generally favorable; low recurrence |

### Histopathologic Patterns of PACNS

| Pattern | Frequency | Characteristics | Prognosis |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Granulomatous | ~50% | Granulomas with multinucleated giant cells; often small vessel | Worst prognosis; higher relapse rate; may overlap with ABRA |
| Lymphocytic | ~30% | Lymphocytic infiltration of vessel walls without granulomas | Moderate prognosis; may respond better to immunosuppression |
| Necrotizing | ~20% | Fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls; resembles systemic vasculitis | Variable; more aggressive acute course |

### Red Flags Suggesting PACNS Over Other Diagnoses

- [ ] Subacute progressive headache with cognitive decline over weeks to months
- [ ] Multifocal infarcts in multiple vascular territories not explained by cardiac source
- [ ] CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated protein and normal glucose
- [ ] MRI showing multifocal infarcts + white matter changes + leptomeningeal enhancement
- [ ] Angiography showing multifocal segmental narrowing (beading) in multiple vessels
- [ ] No systemic vasculitis features (no rash, arthritis, renal involvement)
- [ ] No thunderclap headache onset (argues against RCVS)
- [ ] Young or middle-aged patient without traditional stroke risk factors
- [ ] Progressive course despite antiplatelet/anticoagulation therapy
- [ ] Biopsy showing granulomatous, lymphocytic, or necrotizing inflammation of leptomeningeal/cortical vessels
