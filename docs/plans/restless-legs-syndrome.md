# Restless Legs Syndrome

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 29, 2026
**REVISED:** January 29, 2026
**STATUS:** Complete

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) / Willis-Ekbom Disease

**ICD-10:** G25.81 (Restless legs syndrome), G25.89 (Other specified extrapyramidal and movement disorders), G47.61 (Periodic limb movement disorder)

**SYNONYMS:** Restless legs syndrome, RLS, Willis-Ekbom disease, WED, restless leg syndrome, Ekbom syndrome, anxietas tibiarum, leg jitters, nocturnal leg cramps (often confused with), periodic limb movement disorder, PLMD, akathisia (related)

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis and management of restless legs syndrome in adults. Covers diagnostic criteria, workup for secondary causes, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment, and prevention of augmentation. Excludes periodic limb movement disorder as separate entity, akathisia, and leg cramps.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS):** Neurological sensorimotor disorder characterized by urge to move legs, usually accompanied by uncomfortable sensations, with circadian pattern and relief with movement
- **Augmentation:** Paradoxical worsening of RLS with dopaminergic treatment: earlier onset, spread to arms, shorter latency, increased intensity
- **Periodic Limb Movements of Sleep (PLMS):** Repetitive limb movements during sleep, often associated with RLS (but can occur independently)
- **Refractory RLS:** RLS not adequately controlled by standard treatments

---

**DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (IRLSSG 2014):**

**All 5 essential criteria must be met:**

1. **Urge to move the legs** usually accompanied by uncomfortable sensations in the legs (may occur without)
2. **Symptoms worsen during rest or inactivity** (lying, sitting)
3. **Symptoms partially or totally relieved by movement** (walking, stretching) at least as long as activity continues
4. **Symptoms occur exclusively or predominantly in evening/night** (worse at night than day)
5. **Not solely accounted for by another condition** (leg cramps, positional discomfort, myalgia, venous stasis, leg edema, arthritis, habitual foot tapping, akathisia)

**Supportive Features:**
- Family history of RLS
- Response to dopaminergic therapy
- Periodic limb movements (on PSG or actigraphy)

**Severity (IRLS Rating Scale):**
- Mild: 0-10
- Moderate: 11-20
- Severe: 21-30
- Very severe: 31-40

## NOTES

- RLS is primarily a clinical diagnosis based on 5 essential criteria
- Iron deficiency is the most important reversible cause - check ferritin in ALL patients
- Target ferritin >75 ng/mL (many experts prefer >100)
- Alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin, pregabalin) are now FIRST-LINE due to lower augmentation risk
- Dopamine agonists cause augmentation in up to 70% of patients over 10 years
- If using dopamine agonists, use LOWEST effective dose
- Augmentation = earlier onset, spread to arms, shorter latency, higher intensity
- Many common medications worsen RLS (antihistamines, metoclopramide, antipsychotics)
- RLS is common in pregnancy (~25%); iron deficiency is often the cause
- RLS is common in ESRD (~30%); optimizing dialysis and treating iron deficiency helps
- Opioids are reserved for refractory cases; effective but addiction concern
