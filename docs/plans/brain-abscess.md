### LUMBAR PUNCTURE

**Indication:** Generally CONTRAINDICATED in brain abscess due to risk of herniation. LP should NOT be performed if brain abscess is suspected or confirmed.

**When LP may be considered:** Only if meningitis is a concurrent concern AND imaging shows no significant mass effect, midline shift, or posterior fossa lesion. Even then, proceed with extreme caution.

**Volume Required:** 10-15 mL if performed

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | Rationale | Target Finding |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|-----------|----------------|
| Opening pressure | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Elevated ICP assessment (expected elevated with mass lesion) | Elevated (often >200 mm H2O); markedly elevated is common |
| Cell count with differential (tubes 1 and 4) (CPT 89051) | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Mixed pleocytosis; may be normal if abscess well-encapsulated and not ruptured into ventricles | Variable: WBC 10-500 with mixed neutrophils and lymphocytes; may be normal |
| Protein (CPT 84157) | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Typically mildly to moderately elevated | Elevated (50-200 mg/dL) |
| Glucose with paired serum (CPT 82945) | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Usually normal unless abscess has ruptured into ventricle (ventriculitis) | Normal or mildly low; markedly low suggests ventriculitis or concurrent meningitis |
| Gram stain and bacterial culture (CPT 87205+87070) | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Low yield in brain abscess (positive in <25%); may be positive if ventriculitis | Usually negative; positive with intraventricular rupture |
| Fungal culture (CPT 87102) | - | ROUTINE | - | If immunocompromised or fungal abscess suspected | Negative |
| AFB smear and culture (CPT 87116) | - | ROUTINE | - | If tuberculoma suspected | Negative |

**Special Handling:** CSF culture has very low diagnostic yield in brain abscess. Surgical aspiration of the abscess itself is the gold standard for organism identification.

**Contraindications:** Brain abscess with mass effect (HIGH RISK of herniation); posterior fossa abscess; midline shift; obstructive hydrocephalus. LP is relatively contraindicated in most cases of confirmed brain abscess.

## 3. TREATMENT

### CRITICAL: TREATMENT APPROACH

**Brain abscess requires a dual approach: prolonged antimicrobial therapy AND surgical intervention in most cases.** Antibiotics alone may suffice for small (<2.5 cm), deep-seated lesions or early cerebritis stage.

**Sequence:**
1. Blood cultures (before antibiotics if obtainable without delay)
2. Empiric IV antibiotics STAT
3. CT/MRI to confirm diagnosis
4. Neurosurgery consultation for aspiration/excision
5. Targeted antibiotics based on culture results
6. 6-8 weeks total IV antibiotic course
7. Serial imaging to confirm resolution

## APPENDIX A: CLASSIC PRESENTATION AND RED FLAGS

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Classic triad | Headache (70%), fever (50%), focal neurologic deficit (50%); full triad present in <50% |
| Most common symptom | Headache (70-80%) — often progressive over days to weeks |
| Fever | Present in only 50% at presentation; absence does NOT exclude brain abscess |
| Seizures | Present at diagnosis in 25-35%; lifetime incidence 25-50% |
| Papilledema | Present in 25%; indicates elevated ICP |
| Red flags for rapid deterioration | Sudden severe headache (intraventricular rupture); rapid GCS decline; new fixed dilated pupil (herniation); meningismus (ventriculitis) |
| Stages | Cerebritis (days 1-9) → capsule formation (days 10-14+); capsule thinner on ventricular side (risk of rupture) |

## APPENDIX B: ORGANISMS BY SOURCE OF BRAIN ABSCESS

| Source | Typical Location | Common Organisms | Empiric Regimen |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Dental / Odontogenic (25-30%) | Frontal lobe, temporal lobe | Streptococci (S. anginosus group), Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Bacteroides, Actinomyces | Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole |
| Otogenic (mastoiditis, cholesteatoma) (15-20%) | Temporal lobe, cerebellum | Streptococci, Bacteroides, Pseudomonas, Proteus, anaerobes | Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole |
| Sinogenic (frontal sinusitis) (10-15%) | Frontal lobe | Streptococci, Haemophilus, anaerobes, Staphylococci | Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole |
| Hematogenous (endocarditis, lung, IVDU) (15-25%) | Multiple abscesses (MCA territory) | S. aureus, Streptococci, gram-negatives, polymicrobial | Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole + Vancomycin |
| Post-surgical / Post-traumatic (10-15%) | Adjacent to surgical site or skull fracture | S. aureus (MRSA), S. epidermidis, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas | Vancomycin + Ceftazidime or Meropenem |
| Congenital heart disease / Pulmonary AVM | Multiple (right-to-left shunt) | Streptococci, Haemophilus, anaerobes | Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole |
| Immunocompromised (HIV, transplant) | Variable; often deep/basal ganglia | Toxoplasma, Nocardia, Aspergillus, Mucor, Cryptococcus, Listeria | Based on suspected organism + empiric broad-spectrum |
| Cryptogenic (unknown source, 15-20%) | Variable | Streptococci (S. anginosus group) most common; polymicrobial | Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole + Vancomycin |

## APPENDIX C: SURGICAL DECISION ALGORITHM

| Clinical Scenario | Recommended Approach | Rationale |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Abscess <2.5 cm, early cerebritis | Medical management alone (antibiotics only) | Small abscesses and cerebritis may resolve with antibiotics alone; aspiration technically difficult |
| Abscess >2.5 cm, accessible location | Stereotactic aspiration + antibiotics | Standard approach; less invasive than craniotomy; culture-directed therapy; may need repeat aspiration in 20-30% |
| Multiloculated abscess | Craniotomy with excision | Aspiration ineffective for septated collections; excision provides definitive drainage |
| Posterior fossa abscess | Craniotomy with excision (preferred) | High risk of brainstem compression and obstructive hydrocephalus; rapid decompression required |
| Fungal abscess (Aspergillus, Mucor) | Craniotomy with excision + antifungals | Poor antifungal penetration into abscess; surgical debridement critical |
| Traumatic abscess with foreign body | Craniotomy with excision + foreign body removal | Foreign body prevents resolution; source of persistent infection |
| Deep-seated (thalamus, brainstem) | Medical management or stereotactic aspiration if enlarging | Surgical risk outweighs benefit for open excision; stereotactic aspiration if accessible |
| Failed aspiration (re-accumulation x2) | Craniotomy with excision | Repeated aspiration failure indicates need for definitive surgical treatment |
| Intraventricular rupture | EVD placement + IV antibiotics + intrathecal antibiotics (consider) | Emergency; mortality 80-100% without intervention; CSF diversion critical |

## APPENDIX D: ANTIBIOTIC DURATION GUIDE

| Scenario | IV Duration | Total Duration | Notes |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Standard brain abscess (post-aspiration) | 6-8 weeks IV | 6-8 weeks | Serial imaging to confirm resolution |
| Medical management only (small abscess) | 6-8 weeks IV | 8-12 weeks | May need longer due to lack of surgical drainage; close imaging follow-up |
| Post-excision (complete removal) | 4-6 weeks IV | 4-6 weeks | Shorter course acceptable with confirmed complete excision |
| Nocardia brain abscess | 6-8 weeks IV then PO | 6-12 months total | Long-term oral therapy (TMP-SMX) essential; high relapse rate |
| Toxoplasma brain abscess (HIV) | 6 weeks induction | Lifelong maintenance | Maintenance until immune reconstitution (CD4 >200 for 6 months on ART) |
| Fungal abscess (Aspergillus) | 4-6 weeks IV | 6-12 months total | Transition to oral voriconazole; duration guided by imaging |
| Actinomyces brain abscess | 4-6 weeks IV | 6-12 months PO | Prolonged oral penicillin/amoxicillin after IV induction |
