Covers sleepwalking (somnambulism), sleep terrors (pavor nocturnus), confusional arousals, and related variants including sleep-related eating disorder and sexsomnia. Critical focus on differentiating from nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. Includes diagnostic workup, safety interventions, trigger management, and pharmacotherapy. Excludes REM sleep behavior disorder (separate plan), nightmare disorder, and pediatric-specific management.",
