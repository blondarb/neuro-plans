**SCOPE:** Acute evaluation and management of hypertensive encephalopathy in the ED, hospital, and ICU settings. Includes differentiation from other causes of acute encephalopathy with hypertension, recognition of PRES overlap, blood pressure management protocols, and identification of underlying etiologies. Not primarily an outpatient template — focuses on the acute presentation.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Hypertensive encephalopathy:** Acute or subacute neurological syndrome (headache, confusion, visual disturbance, seizures) caused by failure of cerebral autoregulation in the setting of severe hypertension; BP typically >180/120 mmHg but may occur at lower thresholds in previously normotensive patients (e.g., eclampsia, acute glomerulonephritis)
- **Hypertensive emergency:** Severe hypertension (typically >180/120 mmHg) with evidence of acute target organ damage (brain, heart, kidneys, eyes, aorta)
- **PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome):** Clinico-radiologic syndrome characterized by headache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual disturbance with characteristic vasogenic edema predominantly in posterior cerebral regions on MRI; associated with hypertension, eclampsia, immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, tacrolimus), cytotoxic chemotherapy, renal failure, autoimmune disease
- **Cerebral autoregulation:** Physiologic mechanism maintaining constant cerebral blood flow across a range of mean arterial pressures (MAP ~60-150 mmHg in normotensives; shifted rightward in chronic hypertension); failure leads to hyperperfusion, blood-brain barrier breakdown, and vasogenic edema
- **Malignant hypertension:** Severe hypertension with evidence of end-organ damage including papilledema, retinal hemorrhages, renal insufficiency, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia

## Section 3: Treatment

> **CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:** Blood pressure reduction must be gradual and controlled. Excessive or rapid reduction can cause watershed ischemia or stroke, particularly in patients with chronic hypertension and rightward-shifted autoregulation.

### 3A — Acute / Emergency Treatment (ED and ICU)

**Initial BP Target — First 1 hour:**
- Reduce MAP by **no more than 25%** from presenting value in the first hour
- If BP >220/120: target initial reduction to ~160-180/100-110 mmHg
- Exception: aortic dissection (target SBP <120 mmHg rapidly)
- Exception: ischemic stroke in thrombolysis window (follow stroke protocol — SBP <185/110)

**IV Antihypertensive Agents (ICU setting — continuous infusion preferred):**

| Medication | Dose | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Nicardipine IV infusion | 5 mg/hr :: IV :: continuous infusion :: start 5 mg/hr, titrate by 2.5 mg/hr every 5-15 min, max 15 mg/hr | **First-line preferred** — smooth, titratable, no rebound; good for most hypertensive emergencies including PRES |
| Labetalol IV | 20 mg :: IV :: bolus over 2 min :: may repeat 40-80 mg every 10 min (max 300 mg total); or infusion 0.5-2 mg/min | First-line alternative — combined alpha/beta blockade; avoid in severe bradycardia, heart block, decompensated HF, cocaine-induced (use nicardipine instead) |
| Clevidipine IV | 1-2 mg/hr :: IV :: continuous infusion :: titrate by doubling dose every 90 sec initially, then increase by 1-2 mg/hr; max 32 mg/hr | Ultra-short acting calcium channel blocker; rapid onset/offset; useful when precise BP control needed; lipid emulsion — avoid in soy/egg allergy, pancreatitis |
| Sodium nitroprusside IV | 0.25-0.5 mcg/kg/min :: IV :: continuous infusion :: titrate every 5 min; max 10 mcg/kg/min | **Use only when other agents unavailable** — risk of cyanide toxicity (monitor thiocyanate levels if >48h); theoretical concern about increasing ICP; requires arterial line |
| Fenoldopam IV | 0.1 mcg/kg/min :: IV :: continuous infusion :: titrate by 0.05-0.1 mcg/kg/min every 15 min | Dopamine-1 agonist — renal protective effects; useful in hypertensive emergency with renal insufficiency |
| Hydralazine IV | 10-20 mg :: IV :: bolus every 4-6 hours | Unpredictable response, long duration — NOT recommended first-line; consider only if other agents unavailable; commonly used in eclampsia (with magnesium) |

**Seizure Management (if seizures occur — common in PRES):**

| Medication | Dose | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Lorazepam IV | 4 mg :: IV :: bolus over 2 min :: may repeat x1 after 5 min | First-line for acute seizures; have airway equipment ready |
| Levetiracetam IV | 1000-1500 mg :: IV :: load over 15 min :: then 500-1000 mg BID | Preferred maintenance ASM — no hepatic metabolism, minimal drug interactions; safe in pregnancy |
| Fosphenytoin IV | 20 mg PE/kg :: IV :: load at 150 mg PE/min :: then 5 mg PE/kg/day | Alternative load if seizures persist; monitor for hypotension and arrhythmia during infusion |
| Magnesium sulfate IV | 4-6 g :: IV :: load over 15-20 min :: then 1-2 g/hr | **First-line for eclampsia-related seizures** — superior to phenytoin and diazepam (MAGPIE trial); monitor reflexes, UO |

### 3B — First-Line Maintenance Treatment (Hospital/Transition)

**Oral BP Transition (once IV control achieved and stable for 6-12 hours):**

| Medication | Dose | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Amlodipine PO | 5-10 mg :: PO :: once daily :: start 5 mg, titrate to 10 mg | Long-acting CCB; smooth onset; good first-line oral agent for transition |
| Lisinopril PO | 10-40 mg :: PO :: once daily :: start 10 mg | ACE inhibitor; avoid in bilateral renal artery stenosis, pregnancy, hyperkalemia |
| Losartan PO | 50-100 mg :: PO :: once daily :: start 50 mg | ARB; alternative to ACE-I (cough, angioedema); avoid in pregnancy |
| Labetalol PO | 200-800 mg :: PO :: BID :: start 200 mg BID | Oral continuation if IV labetalol was effective |
| Chlorthalidone PO | 12.5-25 mg :: PO :: once daily | Thiazide-like diuretic; consider adding for resistant hypertension |

### 3C — Second-Line / Adjunctive Treatment

| Medication | Dose | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Hydralazine PO | 25-50 mg :: PO :: TID-QID | Direct vasodilator; often combined with nitrate to offset reflex tachycardia |
| Clonidine PO | 0.1-0.3 mg :: PO :: BID-TID | Central alpha-2 agonist; useful as add-on; avoid abrupt discontinuation (rebound hypertension) |
| Minoxidil PO | 5-10 mg :: PO :: BID :: start 5 mg | Potent vasodilator; reserved for truly resistant hypertension; causes fluid retention and hirsutism |
| Spironolactone PO | 25-50 mg :: PO :: once daily | Aldosterone antagonist; effective in resistant hypertension; monitor potassium |
| Dexamethasone IV | 4-8 mg :: IV :: every 6 hours | **Only for PRES with significant mass effect** — role controversial; some evidence for reducing vasogenic edema |

### 3D — Eclampsia-Specific Treatment

| Medication | Dose | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Magnesium sulfate IV | 4-6 g :: IV :: load over 15-20 min :: then 1-2 g/hr :: continue 24 hours postpartum | **Definitive seizure treatment and prophylaxis in eclampsia** — superior to all other agents |
| Labetalol IV (pregnancy) | 20 mg :: IV :: bolus :: then 40-80 mg every 10-20 min (max 300 mg) | First-line antihypertensive in pregnancy-related hypertensive emergency |
| Hydralazine IV (pregnancy) | 5-10 mg :: IV :: every 20-30 min | Traditional agent for eclampsia/preeclampsia; less predictable than labetalol |
| Nifedipine PO (pregnancy) | 10-20 mg :: PO :: every 30 min (immediate release for acute) | Oral option for acute BP control in preeclampsia; avoid sublingual route |

> **DO NOT USE in eclampsia/pregnancy:** Sodium nitroprusside (fetal cyanide toxicity), ACE inhibitors, ARBs (teratogenic), atenolol (IUGR)

## Section 4: Other Recommendations

### 4A — Referrals

| Referral | Setting | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Nephrology | HOSP/ICU | Hypertensive nephropathy, acute kidney injury, secondary hypertension workup |
| Cardiology | HOSP/ICU | Acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, aortic dissection, malignant hypertension with cardiac involvement |
| Neurology | HOSP/ICU | Seizure management, PRES diagnosis, differentiation from stroke, altered mental status workup |
| Obstetrics (MFM) | HOSP/ICU | All cases of eclampsia/preeclampsia — co-management mandatory |
| Ophthalmology | HOSP | Formal fundoscopy — grade retinopathy, assess for papilledema |
| Endocrinology | OPD | Secondary hypertension workup (pheochromocytoma, Cushing, Conn syndrome, renovascular HTN) |

### 4B — Patient and Family Instructions

- **Explain the diagnosis:** Extremely high blood pressure has caused brain swelling — this is reversible with careful blood pressure control
- **Medication compliance:** Emphasize that hypertensive encephalopathy occurs almost always in the setting of untreated or undertreated hypertension; medication adherence is critical to prevent recurrence
- **Warning signs for return to ED:** New headache, vision changes, confusion, weakness, seizure, chest pain, shortness of breath
- **Home blood pressure monitoring:** Instruct on proper technique; target per clinician; log readings for follow-up
- **Medication side effects:** Review specific agent side effects; emphasize not to stop medications abruptly (especially clonidine, beta-blockers)
- **Follow-up:** Close outpatient follow-up within 1-2 weeks of discharge for BP titration; nephrology and cardiology follow-up as arranged

### 4C — Lifestyle and Secondary Prevention

- **Sodium restriction:** <2 g/day (DASH diet) — evidence-based for BP reduction (~5-6 mmHg SBP)
- **Weight management:** If overweight/obese, target gradual loss — each 1 kg lost ≈ 1 mmHg SBP reduction
- **Alcohol limitation:** ≤1 drink/day (women), ≤2 drinks/day (men)
- **Physical activity:** 150 min/week of moderate aerobic exercise once medically cleared
- **Smoking cessation:** Strong recommendation; referral to cessation program
- **Substance avoidance:** Cocaine, amphetamines, phencyclidine — direct precipitants
- **Medication reconciliation:** Evaluate all medications including NSAIDs, decongestants, OCPs, stimulants that raise BP

## Section 5: Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Key Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Ischemic stroke with reactive hypertension** | Focal neurological deficits, DWI-positive on MRI, hypertension may be reactive not causative; follow stroke protocol |
| **Intracerebral hemorrhage** | Focal deficits, CT shows hemorrhage; hypertension may be cause or result; urgent neurosurgical evaluation |
| **Subarachnoid hemorrhage** | Thunderclap headache, meningismus, blood on CT or LP; may have associated hypertension |
| **PRES (non-hypertensive)** | Immunosuppressant use (cyclosporine, tacrolimus), chemotherapy, autoimmune flare, renal failure; BP may be normal or only moderately elevated; MRI pattern distinguishes |
| **Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS)** | Recurrent thunderclap headaches, segmental vasoconstriction on angiography; may overlap with PRES; different treatment (CCBs, avoid steroids) |
| **Meningoencephalitis** | Fever, nuchal rigidity, CSF pleocytosis; may have co-existing hypertension |
| **Cerebral venous thrombosis** | Headache, papilledema, focal deficits, seizures; elevated D-dimer; MRV diagnostic |
| **Status epilepticus (non-hypertensive)** | Seizures may cause transient severe hypertension; distinguish primary seizure from PRES-related seizure |
| **TTP-HUS** | Pentad: MAHA, thrombocytopenia, neurologic symptoms, renal failure, fever; check ADAMTS13 |
| **Pheochromocytoma crisis** | Paroxysmal hypertension, headache, diaphoresis, palpitations; elevated plasma metanephrines |
| **Eclampsia** | Pregnant or postpartum ≤6 weeks, hypertension, proteinuria, seizures; unique management (magnesium) |
| **Uremic encephalopathy** | Severe renal failure (GFR <15), asterixis, myoclonus; BUN typically >100; dialysis is definitive treatment |

---

## Section 6: Monitoring Parameters

| Parameter | Frequency | Target/Goal |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Arterial blood pressure (invasive)** | Continuous (arterial line in ICU) | MAP reduction ≤25% in first hour; SBP 160-180 first 2-6 hours; gradual further reduction over 24-48 hours |
| **Neurological exam (GCS, pupils, focal signs)** | Every 1-2 hours (ICU); every 4 hours (floor) | Improvement in mental status, resolution of visual symptoms, no new focal deficits |
| **Renal function (Cr, BUN, electrolytes)** | Every 6-12 hours (acute); daily (stable) | Stable or improving creatinine; watch for excessive BP drop causing AKI |
| **Urine output** | Hourly (ICU); every 4 hours (floor) | >0.5 mL/kg/hr |
| **Cardiac monitoring (telemetry)** | Continuous | Arrhythmia detection, rate control |
| **Fundoscopic examination** | Daily (inpatient) | Resolution of papilledema, improvement in retinopathy |
| **Repeat MRI brain** | 24-72 hours and/or before discharge | Resolution or improvement of PRES findings; confirm no progression to infarction |
| **EEG (if seizures)** | Continuous (ICU) until seizure-free 24h | No electrographic seizures; no nonconvulsive status |
| **Serum lactate** | Every 6-12 hours (if elevated initially) | Normalization — indicator of improved perfusion |

---

## Notes

- **The 25% rule is paramount** — excessive blood pressure reduction can convert PRES (reversible vasogenic edema) to infarction (irreversible cytotoxic edema). "Treat the patient, not the number."
- **PRES is not always posterior** — 15-20% of cases involve anterior circulation, brainstem, or cerebellum; atypical distribution does not exclude the diagnosis.
- **PRES is not always reversible** — 10-15% develop permanent infarction or hemorrhage, especially if BP correction is delayed or if there is hemorrhagic transformation.
- **Chronic hypertensives vs normotensives** — Chronically hypertensive patients have rightward-shifted autoregulation and tolerate higher BPs but are vulnerable to excessive lowering. Previously normotensive patients (eclampsia, acute GN) may develop encephalopathy at lower thresholds (e.g., 160/100).
- **Drug-induced PRES** — cyclosporine, tacrolimus, cisplatin, bevacizumab, interferon-alpha can cause PRES independent of BP elevation. Drug withdrawal is primary treatment.
- **Continuous arterial monitoring** — Use arterial line for any patient on IV antihypertensive infusion; non-invasive cuff measurements have significant variability in this setting.
- **Nicardipine over nitroprusside** — Modern practice strongly favors nicardipine as first-line; nitroprusside carries cyanide risk, is difficult to titrate, and theoretically raises ICP.
- **Cocaine-induced hypertensive emergency** — Use nicardipine or phentolamine; **avoid pure beta-blockers** (including labetalol is debated) due to risk of unopposed alpha stimulation. Benzodiazepines are first-line to reduce sympathetic drive.
