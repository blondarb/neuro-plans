## 1. LABORATORY WORKUP

### 1A. Essential/Core Labs

| Test | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale | Target Finding |
|------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|----------------|
| ASM trough levels (all current ASMs) (CPT 80201-80299) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | - | Routine monitoring of adherence and therapeutic dosing; obtain trough level (before morning dose); establish individual therapeutic level when seizure-free | Within therapeutic range; document individual target level when well controlled |
| CBC with differential (CPT 85025) | - | STAT | ROUTINE | - | Annual monitoring for ASM hematologic effects; carbamazepine (leukopenia, aplastic anemia rare); valproate (thrombocytopenia); felbamate (aplastic anemia) | Normal; WBC <3500 or platelets <100K → evaluate ASM cause |
| CMP (BMP + LFTs) (CPT 80053) | - | STAT | ROUTINE | - | Annual monitoring of hepatic function (ASM metabolism, hepatotoxicity); renal function (ASM dosing); electrolytes (hyponatremia with carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine) | Normal; hyponatremia → ASM-related SIADH; elevated LFTs → evaluate hepatotoxicity |
| Sodium (CPT 84295) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | - | Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine cause SIADH; routine monitoring q3-6 months for these agents | 135-145 mEq/L; <130 → consider ASM change |
| Magnesium (CPT 83735) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | - | Chronic ASM use may deplete magnesium; hypomagnesemia lowers seizure threshold | >2.0 mg/dL; low → supplement |
| Pregnancy test (β-hCG) (CPT 84703) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | - | Annual screening for women of childbearing potential; before ASM changes; many ASMs are teratogenic | Negative; positive → urgent ASM safety review and OB referral |

### 1B. Extended Workup (Second-line)

| Test | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale | Target Finding |
|------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|----------------|
| Vitamin D, 25-OH (CPT 82306) | - | - | ROUTINE | - | Annual screening for ALL epilepsy patients; enzyme-inducing ASMs (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) and valproate accelerate vitamin D metabolism → osteoporosis and fractures | >30 ng/mL; <20 → supplement 2000-5000 IU/day; recheck 3 months |
| B12 (CPT 82607) / Folate (CPT 82746) | - | - | ROUTINE | - | Phenytoin and carbamazepine deplete folate; B12 screening in elderly; folate critical for women of childbearing potential (neural tube defect prevention) | Normal; low folate → supplement 1-4 mg/day |
| Lipid panel (CPT 80061) | - | - | ROUTINE | - | Enzyme-inducing ASMs increase total cholesterol and LDL; cardiovascular risk monitoring | Normal; elevated → statin if indicated; consider switching to non-enzyme-inducing ASM |
| TSH (CPT 84443) | - | - | ROUTINE | - | Annual thyroid screening; valproate and carbamazepine can affect thyroid function; hypothyroidism increases seizure threshold (protective) but may cause fatigue | Normal |

| Ammonia (CPT 82140) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | - | Annual or PRN for patients on valproate; encephalopathy can occur with normal LFTs; also check if new confusion/lethargy | <35 μmol/L; elevated → consider carnitine supplementation or valproate dose reduction |
| DEXA bone density scan referral (CPT 77080) | - | - | ROUTINE | - | Baseline for patients on enzyme-inducing ASMs >2 years; all patients >50; seizure-related falls increase fracture risk | Normal T-score (>-1.0); osteopenia/osteoporosis → treat |
| Testosterone (total and free) (CPT 84403) | - | - | EXT | - | Enzyme-inducing ASMs increase sex hormone-binding globulin → low free testosterone; may cause sexual dysfunction, depression, fatigue in men | Normal; low → endocrinology referral |
| Cortisol, AM (CPT 82533) | - | - | EXT | - | Enzyme-inducing ASMs may affect cortisol; evaluate if fatigue is prominent | Normal |

### 1C. Rare/Specialized (Refractory or Atypical)

| Test | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale | Target Finding |
|------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|----------------|

| CYP2C19 genotyping (CPT 81225) | - | - | EXT | - | Poor metabolizers accumulate N-desmethylclobazam (active metabolite); excessive sedation on standard clobazam doses | Normal metabolizer; poor → reduce clobazam dose 50% |
| Carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide level (CPT 80156) | - | - | ROUTINE | - | Active metabolite check when on carbamazepine + valproate (VPA inhibits epoxide hydrolase); toxicity with normal parent level | <9 mcg/mL; elevated → clinical toxicity |
| Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) (CPT 82397) | - | - | EXT | - | Ovarian reserve assessment for women with epilepsy planning pregnancy; valproate associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) | Normal for age; low → fertility referral |

## 4. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS

### 4A. Referrals & Consults

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Neurology follow-up every 3-6 months for seizure-free patients; every 1-3 months during ASM changes or if not well controlled | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Comprehensive epilepsy center referral if seizures persist despite two or more appropriately chosen ASMs (meets ILAE definition of drug-resistant epilepsy) | - | URGENT | ROUTINE | - |
| Psychiatry referral for depression or anxiety screening positive (PHQ-9 ≥10 or GAD-7 ≥10); psychiatric comorbidities affect seizure control and quality of life | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Reproductive endocrinology or OB/GYN referral for preconception counseling in women of childbearing potential; ASM teratogenicity review and optimization before pregnancy | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Neuropsychological testing referral for cognitive complaints potentially related to ASMs; baseline assessment before surgery evaluation or ASM changes | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Endocrinology referral for metabolic bone disease (osteoporosis on DEXA); PCOS in women on valproate; testosterone deficiency in men on enzyme-inducing ASMs | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Social work for disability documentation, vocational rehabilitation, insurance assistance, and community support services | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Driving evaluation by state DMV and neurology documentation of seizure-free interval per state requirements; commercial driving restrictions per federal DOT regulations | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Ophthalmology referral for patients on vigabatrin (visual field testing q3 months) or any patient with visual complaints | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Take ASMs at the same time every day; use pill organizers and phone alarms; missing even one dose increases seizure risk — contact neurologist if unable to afford or obtain medications | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Maintain consistent sleep schedule with 7-9 hours nightly; sleep deprivation is the strongest modifiable seizure trigger; avoid shift work if possible | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Do not stop ASMs abruptly; sudden discontinuation can trigger status epilepticus even in well-controlled patients — always taper under neurologist guidance | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Return to ED immediately if seizure lasts >5 minutes, multiple seizures without recovery, seizure in water, significant injury during seizure, or first seizure in pregnancy | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE |
| Do not drive until seizure-free for state-mandated period (typically 3-12 months); report seizures to neurologist for driving documentation; commercial driving has stricter federal requirements | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Women of childbearing potential: use reliable contraception (IUD preferred over oral contraceptives if on enzyme-inducing ASMs); notify neurologist BEFORE planning pregnancy for medication optimization | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Inform all prescribing doctors and pharmacists about epilepsy and ASMs before starting new medications; many drugs interact with ASMs (antibiotics, antidepressants, pain medications) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Avoid excessive alcohol (alcohol withdrawal and binge drinking lower seizure threshold); if consuming alcohol, limit to 1 drink maximum with food | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Carry medical alert identification (bracelet or app) with epilepsy diagnosis and medications listed | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Regular aerobic exercise (30 minutes, 5 days/week) improves seizure control, mood, and cardiovascular health; no restriction on exercise type unless frequent tonic/drop seizures (avoid swimming alone, climbing) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Stress reduction through regular exercise, mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy; chronic stress is an independent seizure trigger | - | - | ROUTINE |
| Weight management: topiramate and zonisamide may help with weight loss; valproate and pregabalin may cause weight gain — consider when selecting ASMs | - | - | ROUTINE |
| Bone health: weight-bearing exercise, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, DEXA screening, and bisphosphonate if osteoporotic — especially critical for patients on enzyme-inducing ASMs | - | - | ROUTINE |
| Home safety: shower instead of baths, avoid locked bathroom doors, use stove guards, microwave preferred over stovetop, carpeted floors reduce injury risk during falls | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| SUDEP awareness: discuss SUDEP risk openly; optimizing seizure control is the best prevention; nocturnal supervision and seizure detection devices reduce risk | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |

## APPENDIX C: ASM Withdrawal Protocol

**Eligibility criteria for ASM withdrawal:**
- Seizure-free ≥2 years (≥5 years preferred for lower recurrence risk)
- Normal or normalized EEG (abnormal EEG doubles recurrence risk)
- Normal MRI or stable known lesion
- Not juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (lifelong treatment typically needed)
- Patient informed of recurrence risk and driving implications
- Patient preference after shared decision-making

**Withdrawal protocol:**
1. Taper one ASM at a time (if on polytherapy)
2. Reduce by 25% of dose every 2-4 weeks
3. Total taper period: 2-6 months depending on ASM and dose
4. Monitor with EEG before and during taper
5. Stop driving during taper and for state-mandated period after last dose
6. If seizure recurs → restart ASM at last effective dose; typically regain control

**Recurrence risk factors:**
- Abnormal EEG before withdrawal: 2x risk
- Known structural lesion: 2x risk
- Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy: >90% recurrence
- Longer seizure-free period: lower risk
- Monotherapy at withdrawal: lower risk than polytherapy
