# Parkinson's Disease - New Diagnosis

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 29, 2026
**REVISED:** January 29, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Parkinson's Disease - New Diagnosis

**ICD-10:** G20 (Parkinson's disease), G20.A1 (Parkinson's disease without dyskinesia, without motor fluctuations), G20.A2 (Parkinson's disease without dyskinesia, with motor fluctuations), G20.B1 (Parkinson's disease with dyskinesia, without motor fluctuations), G20.B2 (Parkinson's disease with dyskinesia, with motor fluctuations), G20.C (Parkinsonism, unspecified)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC), 80053 (CMP), 84443 (TSH), 82607 (Vitamin B12), 86592 (RPR/VDRL), 82390 (Serum ceruloplasmin), 87389 (HIV), 70551 (MRI brain without contrast), 70552 (MRI brain with contrast), 78830 (DaTscan), 78608 (FDG-PET brain), 95810 (Polysomnography)

**SYNONYMS:** Parkinson disease, PD, idiopathic parkinsonism, paralysis agitans, shaking palsy, primary parkinsonism, Parkinson's, parkinsonism, tremor-dominant PD, PIGD

**SCOPE:** Initial diagnosis and early management of idiopathic Parkinson's disease in adults. Covers diagnostic workup to exclude secondary causes and atypical parkinsonism, initiation of symptomatic therapy, and patient education. Excludes drug-induced parkinsonism, atypical parkinsonian syndromes (PSP, MSA, CBD, DLB), juvenile/young-onset PD, and advanced PD with motor fluctuations.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Parkinsonism:** Clinical syndrome of bradykinesia plus rest tremor and/or rigidity
- **Parkinson's Disease (PD):** Neurodegenerative disorder characterized by parkinsonism due to loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra
- **Bradykinesia:** Slowness of movement with progressive reduction in speed and amplitude with repetitive actions
- **Rest Tremor:** 4-6 Hz tremor present at rest, suppressed with action
- **Rigidity:** Increased resistance to passive movement (cogwheel or lead-pipe)

---

**DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (MDS Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for PD, 2015):**

**Essential Criteria:**
- Parkinsonism (bradykinesia + rest tremor OR rigidity)

**Supportive Criteria (≥2 for clinically established PD):**
- Clear beneficial response to dopaminergic therapy
- Presence of levodopa-induced dyskinesias
- Rest tremor of a limb
- Olfactory loss or cardiac sympathetic denervation on MIBG

**Absolute Exclusion Criteria:**
- Cerebellar abnormalities
- Downward vertical supranuclear gaze palsy
- Diagnosis of probable behavioral variant FTD or primary progressive aphasia
- Parkinsonism restricted to lower limbs for >3 years
- Treatment with dopamine receptor blocker or dopamine-depleting agent
- Absence of response to high-dose levodopa
- Unequivocal cortical sensory loss, clear limb ideomotor apraxia, progressive aphasia
- Normal functional neuroimaging of presynaptic dopaminergic system

## NOTES

- PD is a clinical diagnosis; DaTscan supports but does not confirm diagnosis
- Start treatment when symptoms interfere with function or quality of life; no need to wait
- Levodopa is most effective but traditionally delayed due to dyskinesia concerns; recent evidence suggests early levodopa is safe
- Dopamine agonists preferred in younger patients (<65) due to lower dyskinesia risk, but watch for impulse control disorders
- MAO-B inhibitors may have disease-modifying potential (unproven) and are good early monotherapy option
- "Drug holiday" is dangerous - never abruptly stop PD medications (risk of neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome)
- Medications that worsen PD: metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, typical antipsychotics, reserpine, tetrabenazine
- Exercise and physical therapy are as important as medications
