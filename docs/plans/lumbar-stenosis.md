# Lumbar Spinal Stenosis

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** February 9, 2026
**REVISED:** February 9, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Lumbar Spinal Stenosis

**ICD-10:** M48.061 (Spinal stenosis, lumbar region without neurogenic claudication), M48.062 (Spinal stenosis, lumbar region with neurogenic claudication), M99.23 (Subluxation stenosis of neural canal of lumbar region)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC), 80048 (BMP), 84443 (TSH), 82728 (Ferritin), 72148 (MRI lumbar spine without contrast), 72149 (MRI lumbar spine with contrast), 72158 (MRI lumbar spine with/without contrast), 72100 (X-ray lumbar spine 2-3 views), 72131 (CT lumbar spine without contrast), 95907 (Nerve conduction study, 1-2 nerves), 95913 (Nerve conduction study, 9-10 nerves), 95886 (Needle EMG, each extremity), 62322 (Lumbar epidural steroid injection), 63047 (Lumbar laminectomy, single level), 22630 (Lumbar interbody fusion), 97110 (Therapeutic exercises), 97530 (Therapeutic activities)

**SYNONYMS:** Lumbar stenosis, spinal stenosis of lumbar region, lumbar canal stenosis, degenerative lumbar stenosis, neurogenic claudication, lumbar spondylotic stenosis, central canal stenosis, lateral recess stenosis, foraminal stenosis, degenerative spinal stenosis, acquired lumbar stenosis

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis in adults. Includes diagnostic workup, conservative management, interventional procedures, and surgical referral criteria. Covers ED presentation with acute neurological decline, inpatient perioperative management, and outpatient chronic management. Excludes congenital stenosis, cervical/thoracic stenosis, and cauda equina syndrome as separate entities (though cauda equina is addressed as a red flag).

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Lumbar spinal stenosis:** Narrowing of the spinal canal, lateral recesses, or neural foramina in the lumbar region causing compression of neural elements
- **Neurogenic claudication:** Bilateral lower extremity pain, heaviness, or weakness provoked by walking or standing and relieved by sitting or lumbar flexion; hallmark symptom of central lumbar stenosis
- **Central stenosis:** Narrowing of the central spinal canal compressing the thecal sac and cauda equina
- **Lateral recess stenosis:** Narrowing of the lateral recess compressing the traversing nerve root
- **Foraminal stenosis:** Narrowing of the neural foramen compressing the exiting nerve root
- **Spondylolisthesis:** Forward displacement of one vertebral body on another, often contributing to dynamic stenosis
- **Cauda equina syndrome (CES):** Acute compression of the cauda equina with urinary retention, saddle anesthesia, and bilateral leg weakness — surgical emergency

---

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

---

## RED FLAGS — Evaluate Immediately

- **Cauda equina syndrome:** Urinary retention or incontinence, saddle anesthesia, progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness, fecal incontinence — emergent MRI and neurosurgical consultation
- **Rapidly progressive neurologic deficit:** New foot drop or significant motor weakness (<=3/5) developing over hours to days
- **Bowel/bladder dysfunction:** New onset urinary retention, incontinence, or loss of anal sphincter tone
- **Constitutional symptoms with neurologic decline:** Fever, unexplained weight loss, or history of malignancy with progressive weakness (consider epidural abscess or metastatic disease)

## 4. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS

### 4A. Referrals & Consults

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Neurosurgery or spine surgery consultation for cauda equina syndrome (emergent), progressive neurologic deficit, or failure of 3-6 months conservative management | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Physical therapy referral for flexion-based exercise program, core stabilization, and aerobic conditioning (stationary cycling, aquatic therapy) — first-line treatment | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Pain management/interventional spine referral for epidural steroid injections, diagnostic nerve blocks, or multimodal pain management | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| PMR (physiatrist) for comprehensive non-operative management plan including activity modification, assistive devices, and rehabilitation | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Neurology consultation if peripheral neuropathy overlap suspected or if electrodiagnostic testing needed for localization | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Occupational therapy for ADL modification, ergonomic assessment, and adaptive equipment (rolling walker, seated work station) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Lumbar flexion relieves symptoms: lean forward, push a shopping cart, use a rolling walker, or ride a stationary bicycle to open the spinal canal and reduce nerve compression | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid prolonged standing and walking downhill (extension aggravates stenosis); take sitting breaks every 15-30 minutes during walking | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Use a rolling walker or shopping cart for longer walks — leaning forward on a support device increases walking distance by reducing spinal canal narrowing | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Report immediately to ED if loss of bladder or bowel control, numbness in the groin/perineal area (saddle anesthesia), or sudden onset bilateral leg weakness — these indicate cauda equina syndrome requiring emergency surgery | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Take NSAIDs with food to reduce stomach irritation; report any dark stools, stomach pain, or blood in stool immediately | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Attend physical therapy consistently; flexion-based exercises and aerobic conditioning are the foundation of treatment and improve walking distance significantly | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Understand that imaging findings (MRI stenosis) do not always correlate with symptoms — many people have stenosis on MRI without symptoms; treatment targets symptoms, not pictures | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Weight loss (if overweight) reduces spinal loading and may improve symptoms; maintain BMI <30 as a goal | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Perform daily flexion-based exercises: pelvic tilts, knee-to-chest stretches, partial sit-ups, stationary cycling 20-30 minutes; these open the spinal canal and reduce neurogenic claudication | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Maintain healthy weight to reduce axial loading on the lumbar spine; target BMI <30 | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid high-impact activities (running, jumping) and heavy lifting (>25 lbs) which increase disc and facet loading and may worsen stenosis symptoms | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Use proper body mechanics: bend at the knees (not waist), avoid twisting while lifting, and maintain neutral spine alignment during activities | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Aquatic therapy or pool walking provides exercise with buoyancy support, reducing spinal loading while maintaining cardiovascular fitness | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Smoking cessation: smoking impairs blood flow to spinal structures, accelerates disc degeneration, and significantly worsens surgical fusion outcomes | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Optimize bone health: calcium 1000-1200 mg/day, vitamin D 1000-2000 IU/day, and DEXA screening if age >65 or osteoporosis risk factors present | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

## NOTES

- Lumbar spinal stenosis is the most common indication for spine surgery in adults over 65 years
- Neurogenic claudication is the hallmark symptom: bilateral leg pain/weakness provoked by walking and standing, relieved by sitting or flexion (shopping cart sign)
- Distinguish from vascular claudication: neurogenic claudication is relieved by flexion (not just standing still), involves the entire leg (not just calf), and walking distance varies
- MRI severity does not always correlate with symptom severity — treat the patient, not the image
- Physical therapy and activity modification should be tried for at least 6-12 weeks before considering invasive treatment
- Epidural steroid injections provide modest, short-term benefit; not disease-modifying; most useful as a bridge or diagnostic tool
- The SPORT trial demonstrated that surgery provides greater improvement than conservative treatment, but both groups improved over time
- Patients with spondylolisthesis plus stenosis benefit from fusion in addition to decompression (Ghogawala 2016)
- Adjacent segment disease occurs in 10-30% of patients within 10 years of fusion surgery
- Avoid narcotics for chronic management of stenosis pain; emphasize multimodal approach (NSAIDs, gabapentin, PT, ESI)
