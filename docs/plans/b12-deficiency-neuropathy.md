# B12 Deficiency Neuropathy

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** January 30, 2026
**REVISED:** January 30, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** B12 Deficiency Neuropathy

**ICD-10:** E53.8 (Other specified vitamin B deficiencies); G63.4 (Polyneuropathy in nutritional deficiency); G32.0 (Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord in diseases classified elsewhere); D51.0 (Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia due to intrinsic factor deficiency); D51.9 (Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, unspecified); E53.8+G63 (Vitamin B12 deficiency with polyneuropathy)

**SYNONYMS:** B12 deficiency neuropathy, cobalamin deficiency neuropathy, vitamin B12 neuropathy, subacute combined degeneration, SCD, megaloblastic neuropathy, pernicious anemia neuropathy, cobalamin-responsive neuropathy, B12-related myeloneuropathy, cyanocobalamin deficiency, methylcobalamin deficiency, posterior column disease, funicular myelosis

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of neurological manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency including peripheral neuropathy, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, and cognitive changes. Includes diagnosis, treatment, monitoring of neurological recovery, and identification of underlying etiology (pernicious anemia, malabsorption, dietary deficiency). Excludes pure hematologic B12 deficiency without neurological involvement. For general peripheral neuropathy workup, see the Peripheral Neuropathy template.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Subacute Combined Degeneration (SCD):** Demyelination of posterior columns and lateral corticospinal tracts of the spinal cord due to B12 deficiency; presents with sensory ataxia, spasticity, and proprioceptive loss
- **Pernicious Anemia:** Autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells causing intrinsic factor deficiency and B12 malabsorption; most common cause of severe B12 deficiency
- **Methylmalonic Acid (MMA):** Metabolite elevated in B12 deficiency; more sensitive than serum B12 alone; specific for B12 (not elevated in folate deficiency)
- **Homocysteine:** Elevated in both B12 and folate deficiency; less specific than MMA for B12 deficiency alone
- **Intrinsic Factor (IF):** Glycoprotein produced by parietal cells; required for B12 absorption in terminal ileum
- **Holotranscobalamin (Active B12):** The biologically active fraction of circulating B12; may be more sensitive than total B12

**Combination Therapy Note:** For refractory neuropathic pain, combining agents from different classes (e.g., gabapentinoid + SNRI, or gabapentinoid + TCA) is often more effective than maximizing monotherapy. Avoid combining TCAs with SNRIs (serotonin syndrome risk). Neuropathic pain from B12 deficiency often improves or resolves with adequate B12 replacement alone; allow 3-6 months of treatment before concluding pain is refractory.

### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| B12 injections are lifelong if pernicious anemia is the cause; stopping injections will cause neuropathy to recur and worsen | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Neurological symptoms may take 3-12 months to improve after starting B12 replacement; improvement depends on duration and severity of deficiency before treatment | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Return immediately if worsening weakness, difficulty walking, or new bladder/bowel dysfunction develops (may indicate progressive myelopathy requiring urgent evaluation) | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| If self-administering B12 injections, use proper IM technique and rotate injection sites (outer thigh or deltoid); attend injection training with nursing | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Do not take folate supplements without B12 as folate alone may mask B12 deficiency while neurological damage continues to progress | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Inspect feet daily for cuts, blisters, or wounds using a mirror for soles; impaired sensation increases injury risk | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Use night lights, handrails, and remove throw rugs to prevent falls from impaired balance and proprioception | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Test bath water temperature with elbow before entering as impaired sensation increases burn risk | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

| Report new numbness, tingling, or weakness to your neurologist as this may indicate inadequate treatment or alternative diagnosis | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| If vegan or vegetarian, lifelong B12 supplementation is required as plant-based diets contain no natural B12 | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Complete alcohol cessation as alcohol independently causes neuropathy and worsens B12 malabsorption | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Smoking cessation to improve vascular health and support nerve recovery | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Dietary sources of B12: meat, fish, eggs, dairy, fortified cereals; supplement if dietary intake insufficient | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Fall prevention: remove throw rugs, ensure adequate lighting, install grab bars, use assistive devices for sensory ataxia and proprioceptive loss | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Regular exercise as tolerated (walking, swimming, stationary bike) to maintain strength and cardiovascular health; avoid exercises requiring intact proprioception without supervision | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid excessive vitamin B6 supplementation (>100 mg/day) which independently causes peripheral neuropathy | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Annual screening for gastric carcinoid/adenocarcinoma if pernicious anemia confirmed (3-fold increased risk of gastric cancer) | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Metformin users: annual B12 screening as metformin reduces B12 absorption by 10-30% | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Review medications for B12-lowering agents: proton pump inhibitors, H2 blockers, metformin, colchicine, nitrous oxide exposure | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Nitrous oxide avoidance: inform anesthesia team of B12 deficiency before any surgical procedures as N2O irreversibly oxidizes B12 and precipitates acute neurological deterioration | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |

## CHANGE LOG

**v1.1 (January 30, 2026)**
- Eliminated all cross-references ("Same as cyanocobalamin") in Section 3A; hydroxocobalamin IM and cyanocobalamin SC rows now self-contained with full contraindications and monitoring
- Standardized structured dosing format across all treatment sections (3A, 3B, 3C) to `[dose] :: [route] :: [frequency] :: [full_instructions]`
- Added ICU column to Section 4B (Patient Instructions) and Section 4C (Lifestyle & Prevention) for consistent 4-venue coverage
- Cleaned gabapentin contraindications: moved renal dose adjustments to dosing field, added respiratory depression warning with opioids
- Added taper instructions to pregabalin and venlafaxine monitoring
- Corrected nortriptyline monitoring to be self-contained (removed comparative reference to amitriptyline)
- Improved magnesium sulfate dosing: added threshold and oral maintenance step-down
- Added nitrous oxide avoidance to ICU setting (Section 4C) for pre-surgical safety communication

**v1.0 (January 30, 2026)**
- Initial template creation
- Comprehensive laboratory workup including B12, MMA, homocysteine, IF antibodies, anti-parietal cell antibodies, and etiology-directed testing
- MRI spine for subacute combined degeneration with characteristic imaging findings
- EMG/NCS for peripheral neuropathy characterization
- B12 replacement protocols: cyanocobalamin IM, hydroxocobalamin IM, SC route, high-dose oral, sublingual
- Neuropathic pain management with gabapentinoids, SNRIs, TCAs, and topical agents
- Pernicious anemia workup including intrinsic factor antibodies, anti-parietal cell antibodies, gastrin
- Celiac disease screening with tTG-IgA and total IgA
- Comprehensive differential diagnosis including copper deficiency, MS, cervical myelopathy, nitrous oxide toxicity
- Monitoring parameters for treatment response (reticulocyte crisis, B12/MMA normalization, neurological recovery)
- Gastric surveillance recommendations for pernicious anemia
- Patient education on lifelong supplementation, nitrous oxide avoidance, and fall prevention

## APPENDIX A: B12 Replacement Dosing Quick Reference

| Scenario | Route | Induction | Maintenance | Notes |
|----------|-------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Neurological symptoms (any cause) | IM | 1000 mcg IM daily x 7 days | 1000 mcg IM weekly x 4 weeks, then monthly indefinitely | Preferred initial route for neurological disease |
| Pernicious anemia | IM | 1000 mcg IM daily x 7 days | 1000 mcg IM monthly indefinitely | Lifelong; cannot absorb oral B12 via IF pathway |
| Dietary deficiency (vegan/vegetarian) | PO | 1000-2000 mcg PO daily x 8 weeks | 1000 mcg PO daily indefinitely | Monitor MMA at 2-3 months to confirm response |
| Malabsorption (celiac, SIBO, Crohn) | IM | 1000 mcg IM daily x 7 days | 1000 mcg IM monthly until malabsorption corrected | May switch to oral once underlying cause treated |
| Metformin-induced | PO | 1000 mcg PO daily x 8 weeks | 1000 mcg PO daily while on metformin | Annual B12 monitoring recommended |
| Injection-refused or anticoagulated | PO/SL | 2000 mcg PO daily x 8 weeks | 1000-2000 mcg PO daily indefinitely | Monitor MMA closely; switch to IM if inadequate |

## APPENDIX B: Neurological Recovery Timeline

| Domain | Expected Recovery | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Peripheral neuropathy (sensory) | Begins 1-3 months; maximum improvement by 6-12 months | Paresthesias often first to improve; numbness may persist |
| Peripheral neuropathy (motor) | Begins 1-3 months; maximum improvement by 6-12 months | Distal weakness recovers before proximal |
| Proprioceptive loss / sensory ataxia | Begins 3-6 months; may take 12+ months | Incomplete recovery common if treatment delayed |
| Myelopathy (SCD) | Variable; begins 3-6 months | Spasticity and posterior column signs may be permanent if treatment >6 months delayed |
| Cognitive impairment | Begins 1-3 months; may take 12+ months | Dementia component may be partially irreversible |
| Optic neuropathy | Variable; may improve within weeks | Rare; bilateral vision loss |
| Hematologic (anemia) | Reticulocyte crisis day 5-7; Hgb normalizes 6-8 weeks | First sign of treatment response |

**Key principle:** Earlier treatment initiation correlates with better neurological outcomes. Neurological symptoms present for >6 months before treatment have significantly lower chance of full recovery.
