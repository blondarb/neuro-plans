# Myasthenia Gravis - Outpatient Management

**DIAGNOSIS:** Myasthenia Gravis - Outpatient Management
**ICD-10:** G70.00 (Myasthenia gravis without exacerbation), G70.01 (Myasthenia gravis with exacerbation)
**SYNONYMS:** MG, myasthenia, autoimmune myasthenia gravis, ocular myasthenia, generalized myasthenia, AChR-positive MG, MuSK myasthenia, seronegative myasthenia, MG chronic management, MG maintenance therapy
**SCOPE:** Outpatient diagnosis, management, and monitoring of myasthenia gravis in adults. Covers antibody-positive (AChR, MuSK, LRP4) and seronegative MG, ocular and generalized subtypes, pyridostigmine optimization, immunotherapy initiation and monitoring, thymectomy evaluation, and crisis prevention. Excludes myasthenic crisis (see "Myasthenia Gravis - Exacerbation/Crisis"), Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), congenital myasthenic syndromes, and drug-induced myasthenia.

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** January 27, 2026
**REVISED:** January 30, 2026

**STATUS:** Approved

---

**KEY CLINICAL FEATURES:**
- **Fatigable weakness:** Worsens with activity, improves with rest
- **Ocular MG:** Ptosis, diplopia; may remain ocular or generalize (50-80% generalize within 2 years)
- **Generalized MG:** Bulbar (dysarthria, dysphagia, facial weakness), limb (proximal > distal), respiratory
- **Diurnal variation:** Worse later in day, better in morning
- **MuSK MG:** Prominent bulbar, neck, respiratory weakness; less ocular; poor response to pyridostigmine

**ANTIBODY SUBTYPES:**
| Subtype | Frequency | Characteristics |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **AChR-positive** | 85% of generalized, 50% of ocular | Typical MG; thymoma association; good pyridostigmine response |
| **MuSK-positive** | 40% of AChR-negative | Bulbar predominant; less ocular; poor pyridostigmine response; good rituximab response |
| **LRP4-positive** | ~2% of double-negative | Milder phenotype; overlap with AChR+ features |
| **Seronegative** | ~10-15% | May seroconvert; treat as AChR-positive; consider low-affinity antibodies |

---

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

---

!!! warning "CRISIS PREVENTION"
    **Myasthenic crisis occurs in 15-20% of patients.** Recognize warning signs (worsening bulbar/respiratory symptoms, declining FVC) and know medications to avoid. See Section 3E for medications that exacerbate MG.

!!! info "THYMECTOMY CONSIDERATION"
    **Thymectomy improves outcomes in non-thymomatous AChR+ generalized MG age 18-65.** All patients need CT chest to evaluate for thymoma. See Section 4A for referral criteria.

## APPENDIX A: MGFA Clinical Classification

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **I** | Ocular weakness only (ptosis, diplopia) |
| **II** | Mild generalized weakness +/- ocular |
| **IIa** | Predominantly limb/axial |
| **IIb** | Predominantly oropharyngeal/respiratory |
| **III** | Moderate generalized weakness +/- ocular |
| **IIIa** | Predominantly limb/axial |
| **IIIb** | Predominantly oropharyngeal/respiratory |
| **IV** | Severe generalized weakness +/- ocular |
| **IVa** | Predominantly limb/axial |
| **IVb** | Predominantly oropharyngeal/respiratory |
| **V** | Intubation required (with or without mechanical ventilation) |

**Clinical Use:** Document at diagnosis and follow changes. Class IIb, IIIb, IVb (bulbar predominant) have higher aspiration and crisis risk.

## APPENDIX B: Thymectomy Decision Guide

| Factor | Favors Thymectomy | Against/Defer |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Antibody status** | AChR-positive | MuSK-positive (poor evidence); seronegative (limited data) |
| **Age** | 18-65 years (MGTX data) | <18 or >65 (less evidence, still consider) |
| **MG type** | Generalized MG | Ocular MG (controversial; consider if not responding to treatment or generalizing) |
| **Thymoma** | ALL thymomas require resection regardless of MG severity | N/A |
| **Disease stability** | Stable enough for surgery | Actively worsening; optimize with IVIg/PLEX first |
| **Comorbidities** | Good surgical candidate | Poor surgical risk |

**MGTX Trial Key Findings:**
- Thymectomy + prednisone superior to prednisone alone over 3 years
- Lower prednisone requirements
- Fewer immunosuppressants needed
- Fewer exacerbations
- Benefits persist at 5-year follow-up

## APPENDIX D: Crisis Warning Signs - Patient Handout

**SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION IF YOU EXPERIENCE:**

- Difficulty breathing or feeling short of breath
- Trouble swallowing or choking on food/liquids/pills
- Difficulty speaking (slurred or nasal speech) that is new or worsening
- Weakness that is rapidly getting worse
- Fever or signs of infection (infections can trigger crisis)
- Recent exposure to medications on the "avoid" list

**WARNING SIGNS OF IMPENDING CRISIS:**

- Increasing difficulty breathing when lying flat
- Needing more pillows to sleep
- Waking up short of breath at night
- Feeling you can't take a deep breath
- Voice becoming weaker or more nasal
- Difficulty clearing throat or coughing effectively
- Meals taking much longer due to swallowing difficulty
- Choking episodes increasing
- Needing to use neck muscles to breathe

**WHAT TO DO:**

1. Go to emergency department immediately (do not wait for clinic appointment)
2. Bring your medication list and MG card
3. Tell staff you have myasthenia gravis
4. Ask them to contact your neurologist
5. Request they avoid medications on your avoid list
