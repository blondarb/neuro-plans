## 3. TREATMENT PROTOCOLS

### 3A. Acute/Emergent Treatment

| Treatment | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Protocol | Evidence/Rationale |
|-----------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|----------|-------------------|
| **Symptomatic relief (vestibular suppressants)** | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT | **Acute severe vertigo:** Meclizine 25-50 mg PO q6-8h; OR Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) 50 mg PO/IV q6h; OR Promethazine 25 mg PO/IM/IV q6h; OR Ondansetron 4-8 mg IV/PO q8h (for nausea); **IV fluids** for dehydration from vomiting; **Diazepam** 2-5 mg IV/PO for severe acute vertigo (benzodiazepines are potent vestibular suppressants) | Short-term use only (24-72h); vestibular suppressants interfere with central compensation if used chronically; avoid in suspected central cause until stroke ruled out |
| **IV fluids** | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | If dehydrated from vomiting; NS or LR bolus then maintenance; assess orthostatic hypotension | Supportive care; correct volume depletion |
| **Antiemetics** | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT | Ondansetron 4-8 mg IV/PO; metoclopramide 10 mg IV (avoid in elderly — EPS); prochlorperazine 5-10 mg IV/IM | Nausea is often the most debilitating symptom |
| **Rule out stroke** | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | **If ANY central features on HINTS:** STAT MRI with DWI; vascular imaging (MRA or CTA); neurology/stroke consultation; **Central features:** Normal/negative head impulse test, vertical or direction-changing nystagmus, skew deviation, focal neurologic signs, severe imbalance (cannot walk), hearing loss + vertigo without Meniere's history | HINTS is more sensitive than early CT or MRI for posterior circulation stroke; do NOT rely on negative CT to exclude stroke |
| **Epley maneuver (canalith repositioning)** | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT | **For BPPV (positive Dix-Hallpike):** Immediately perform Epley maneuver; highly effective (80-90% single treatment); may repeat if symptoms persist; send home with instructions for home Epley or Brandt-Daroff exercises | Epley is definitive treatment for posterior canal BPPV; medications are NOT indicated for BPPV — repositioning maneuvers are the treatment |

### 3B. Disease-Specific Treatment

#### BENIGN PAROXYSMAL POSITIONAL VERTIGO (BPPV)

| Treatment | Setting | Protocol | Evidence/Rationale |
|-----------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Epley maneuver (posterior canal)** | ED/OPD/HOSP | Standard canalith repositioning; patient starts seated, Dix-Hallpike position for 30 sec, rotate head 90° toward opposite side (30 sec), roll body to face down with head still turned (30 sec), sit up; NNT = 2-3 for resolution | First-line treatment for posterior canal BPPV; highly effective; may repeat same day or next visit |
| **Semont maneuver (alternative)** | OPD | Alternative to Epley; patient moved rapidly from side to side; less commonly used but effective | Alternative if Epley difficult or ineffective |
| **BBQ roll (Lempert maneuver) — horizontal canal** | ED/OPD | For horizontal canal BPPV; patient rotates 360° along long axis of body (log roll) toward unaffected side; 90° increments with 30 sec pauses | Treatment for horizontal canal BPPV; geotropic variant |
| **Brandt-Daroff exercises (home)** | OPD | Patient alternates lying on each side x 30 sec, 10-20 repetitions, 3x daily; habituates symptoms; less effective than Epley for posterior canal | Adjunctive home therapy; may help with residual symptoms; promotes compensation |
| **Avoid vestibular suppressants for BPPV** | All | Do NOT prescribe meclizine for ongoing BPPV treatment; medications delay compensation and do not address the mechanical problem | BPPV is a mechanical problem (otoliths); repositioning is definitive treatment |
| **Post-treatment instructions** | OPD | Avoid lying flat for 1-2 nights (sleep propped up); avoid rapid head movements for 24-48h; avoid affected side lying for 1 week (controversial but commonly recommended) | Reduces immediate recurrence; evidence is mixed |

#### VESTIBULAR NEURITIS / LABYRINTHITIS

| Treatment | Setting | Protocol | Evidence/Rationale |
|-----------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Corticosteroids** | ED/HOSP/OPD | **Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg) x 10 days with taper** OR methylprednisolone 100 mg x 3 days then taper; start within 72 hours of symptom onset for best benefit | Strupp et al. (2004): Steroids improve vestibular function recovery in vestibular neuritis; start early; NNT ~4 for complete recovery |
| **Antivirals (controversial)** | ED/HOSP/OPD | Valacyclovir 1000 mg TID x 7 days; evidence is WEAK; some use empirically if early presentation; thought to be HSV reactivation (like Bell's palsy) | Cochrane review: No clear benefit; some clinicians still use empirically, especially if labyrinthitis with hearing loss |
| **Vestibular suppressants (short-term only)** | ED/HOSP | Meclizine 25 mg q8h OR dimenhydrinate 50 mg q6h OR diazepam 5 mg BID x 1-3 days ONLY; taper off as soon as tolerated | Short-term symptom relief; STOP after 72 hours maximum — prolonged use delays compensation |
| **Early vestibular rehabilitation** | OPD | Refer to vestibular physical therapy; gaze stabilization exercises; balance training; habituation exercises; **START EARLY** (as soon as acute symptoms controlled) | Cochrane review: Vestibular rehabilitation is effective for unilateral vestibular hypofunction; early initiation improves outcomes |
| **Education** | OPD | Explain natural history (acute symptoms resolve over days to weeks; full compensation may take weeks to months); reassurance; avoid prolonged bed rest | Reduce anxiety; promote activity and compensation |

#### MENIERE'S DISEASE

| Treatment | Setting | Protocol | Evidence/Rationale |
|-----------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Dietary modification** | OPD | Low sodium diet (<1500-2000 mg/day); limit caffeine and alcohol; regular meals; avoid MSG | First-line lifestyle modification; reduces endolymphatic hydrops; evidence is limited but widely recommended |
| **Diuretics** | OPD | Hydrochlorothiazide 25-50 mg daily OR hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene (Dyazide, Maxzide); acetazolamide 250 mg BID as alternative | Reduces endolymph volume; widely used despite limited RCT evidence |
| **Betahistine** | OPD | 16-24 mg TID (not available in US; available in Europe, Canada); H1 agonist/H3 antagonist; improves cochlear blood flow | Commonly used in Europe; evidence mixed; may reduce attack frequency |
| **Intratympanic gentamicin** | OPD (Specialist) | Chemical vestibular ablation; destroys vestibular hair cells; reduces vertigo attacks but risks hearing loss; for refractory unilateral disease | Effective for vertigo control (>80%); risk of hearing loss (10-30%); used for refractory cases |
| **Intratympanic steroids** | OPD (Specialist) | Dexamethasone intratympanic injection; may reduce attacks; less destructive than gentamicin | Alternative to gentamicin; preserves hearing; less consistent efficacy |
| **Endolymphatic sac surgery** | OPD (Specialist) | Surgical decompression of endolymphatic sac; evidence is debated; some benefit in select patients | Controversial; Cochrane review shows limited evidence; considered for refractory cases |
| **Vestibular nerve section / Labyrinthectomy** | OPD (Specialist) | Surgical destruction of vestibular nerve (preserves hearing) or entire labyrinth (destroys hearing); for refractory unilateral disease | Last resort; highly effective for vertigo; significant surgery |

#### VESTIBULAR MIGRAINE

| Treatment | Setting | Protocol | Evidence/Rationale |
|-----------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Migraine lifestyle modifications** | OPD | Regular sleep; hydration; avoid triggers (specific to patient); regular meals; stress management | Baseline management for all migraine |
| **Acute treatment** | ED/OPD | Triptans (sumatriptan 50-100 mg PO, 6 mg SQ); NSAIDs; antiemetics (ondansetron, metoclopramide); vestibular suppressants for vertigo component | Standard migraine abortive therapy; triptans can help vestibular symptoms |
| **Preventive therapy** | OPD | **Beta-blockers:** Propranolol 40-160 mg daily; metoprolol 50-200 mg daily; **TCAs:** Amitriptyline 10-75 mg HS; nortriptyline; **Anticonvulsants:** Topiramate 25-100 mg BID; valproate; **SNRIs:** Venlafaxine 37.5-150 mg daily; **Other:** CGRP antagonists (emerging); verapamil | Same preventive agents as migraine; choose based on comorbidities (e.g., depression → amitriptyline; hypertension → beta-blocker) |
| **Vestibular rehabilitation** | OPD | Helpful for chronic vestibular symptoms between attacks; balance training; habituation | May improve chronic symptoms and disability |

#### CENTRAL CAUSES (Posterior Circulation Stroke)

| Treatment | Setting | Protocol | Evidence/Rationale |
|-----------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Stroke protocol** | ED/HOSP/ICU | If central cause suspected or identified: acute stroke protocol; consider IV thrombolysis (tPA/tenecteplase) if within window; endovascular therapy for basilar artery occlusion; aspirin if not tPA candidate; admit to stroke unit | Posterior circulation stroke is life-threatening; basilar artery occlusion has >80% mortality if untreated |
| **Secondary stroke prevention** | HOSP/OPD | Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel x 21 days per CHANCE/POINT); statin; BP control; diabetes management; address vascular risk factors | Per acute ischemic stroke guidelines |
| **Anticoagulation (if indicated)** | HOSP/OPD | If vertebral artery dissection or cardiac source (atrial fibrillation, PFO with high-risk features) | Per stroke etiology |

### 3C. Medications to AVOID or Use with Caution

| Medication | Risk | Action |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **Vestibular suppressants (prolonged use)** | Delay central vestibular compensation; prolong recovery | Limit to 24-72h in acute vestibular neuritis/labyrinthitis; do NOT use for BPPV |
| **Ototoxic medications** (aminoglycosides, loop diuretics, salicylates, cisplatin) | Vestibular and/or cochlear toxicity | Avoid if possible; monitor hearing/vestibular function; limit duration |
| **Alcohol** | Vestibular suppressant; dehydrating; positional alcohol nystagmus | Counsel on avoidance during acute episodes |
| **Benzodiazepines (chronic use)** | Dependence; delay compensation; sedation | Short-term only (1-3 days) for acute severe vertigo |
| **CNS depressants** | May worsen dizziness; impair compensation | Use cautiously; review medication list |
| **Medications causing orthostatic hypotension** (antihypertensives, alpha-blockers, diuretics) | May cause/worsen dizziness | Review; adjust doses; check orthostatics |

| **Onset** | Sudden | Sudden or gradual |
| **Severity** | Often severe; patient feels terrible | Variable; may be mild |
| **Nystagmus** | Unidirectional, horizontal-torsional; suppressed by visual fixation | Direction-changing, vertical, or purely torsional; NOT suppressed by fixation |
| **Head impulse test** | Abnormal (catch-up saccade) | Normal (no saccade) |

### HINTS Exam Interpretation

| Component | Peripheral (Safe) Pattern | Central (Dangerous) Pattern |
|-----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Head Impulse** | ABNORMAL (corrective saccade) | NORMAL (no saccade) |
| **Nystagmus** | Unidirectional (fast phase always beats same direction) | Direction-changing (beats right on right gaze, left on left gaze) OR vertical OR purely torsional |
| **Test of Skew** | Negative (no vertical misalignment) | Positive (eyes at different heights; covered eye moves when uncovered) |

**INFARCT Mnemonic:** **I**mpulse **N**ormal, **F**ast-phase **A**lternating, **R**efixation on cover **T**est = Central pattern = Consider stroke

### Key Guidelines

| Guideline | Source | Year | Key Recommendation |
|-----------|--------|------|-------------------|
| BPPV Practice Guideline | AAO-HNS | 2017 | Dix-Hallpike is gold standard for diagnosis; Epley maneuver is first-line treatment; vestibular suppressants NOT recommended |
| Vestibular Migraine Diagnostic Criteria | ICHD-3 / Barany Society | 2012/2018 | Diagnostic criteria; often underdiagnosed; migraine preventives effective |
| Meniere's Disease Guidelines | AAO-HNS | 2020 | Definite, probable, possible classification; conservative management first; intratympanic therapy for refractory |
| HINTS Exam | Kattah et al. / Tarnutzer | 2009/2011 | HINTS more sensitive than early MRI for stroke in acute vestibular syndrome; requires training |

### Landmark Studies

| Study | Finding | Impact |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Kattah et al. (2009) | HINTS exam (H: head impulse; I: nystagmus; TS: test of skew) was 100% sensitive and 96% specific for stroke in acute vestibular syndrome; superior to MRI in first 24-48h | HINTS should be performed in acute vestibular syndrome; more sensitive than early MRI |
| Strupp et al. (2004) | Methylprednisolone improved vestibular function recovery in vestibular neuritis vs. placebo | Steroids are standard of care for vestibular neuritis |
| Hilton et al. Cochrane (2014) | Epley maneuver highly effective for posterior canal BPPV; NNT ~3 | Epley is definitive treatment for BPPV |
| Tarnutzer et al. (2011) | Individual HINTS components analyzed; normal head impulse most predictive of stroke | "Dangerous" HIT (normal in acute vertigo) = central cause until proven otherwise |
| Choi et al. (2018) | 12-20% of posterior fossa strokes missed on early MRI (<48h) but detected on repeat MRI | If high clinical suspicion for stroke and initial MRI negative, repeat MRI or treat as stroke |
| Fife et al. AAO-HNS (2017) | Comprehensive BPPV guideline; repositioning maneuvers recommended; vestibular suppressants NOT recommended | Standard of care for BPPV |

### HINTS Exam Validity

| Study | Sensitivity for Stroke | Specificity |
|-------|----------------------|-------------|
| Kattah et al. (2009) | 100% | 96% |
| Newman-Toker et al. (2013) | 96% | 98% |
| Tarnutzer et al. (2011, meta-analysis) | 98% (pooled) | 85% (pooled) |

**Important:** HINTS should ONLY be performed in the **Acute Vestibular Syndrome** (continuous vertigo/nystagmus lasting >24h). It is NOT valid for episodic vertigo (BPPV, Meniere's, vestibular migraine).

## APPENDICES

### Appendix A: HINTS Exam Protocol

**Prerequisites:**
- Patient has **ACUTE VESTIBULAR SYNDROME**: Continuous vertigo >24h, nausea/vomiting, nystagmus, gait instability
- Patient has SPONTANEOUS nystagmus visible at rest or with fixation removed
- Examiner is trained in performing and interpreting HINTS

**1. HEAD IMPULSE TEST (HIT)**
- Patient fixates on examiner's nose
- Examiner holds patient's head and delivers small, rapid, unpredictable horizontal head turns (10-20°)
- **NORMAL (dangerous):** Eyes stay on target without corrective saccade
- **ABNORMAL (reassuring):** Corrective saccade back to target after head turn (eyes "catch up")

**2. NYSTAGMUS EVALUATION**
- Observe spontaneous nystagmus in primary gaze
- Then observe in right gaze and left gaze
- **PERIPHERAL (reassuring):** Unidirectional — fast phase always beats the same direction regardless of gaze
- **CENTRAL (dangerous):** Direction-changing — fast phase beats right on right gaze, left on left gaze; OR vertical; OR purely torsional

**3. TEST OF SKEW (Alternate Cover Test)**
- Patient fixates on target
- Cover one eye, then quickly move cover to other eye
- Watch for vertical correction movement of uncovered eye
- **NEGATIVE (reassuring):** No vertical movement
- **POSITIVE (dangerous):** Vertical refixation (eye moves up or down when uncovered)

**Interpretation:**
- **ALL THREE peripheral pattern = Peripheral vestibular lesion** (vestibular neuritis)
- **ANY ONE central pattern = Central lesion likely** → Urgent MRI, stroke workup

### Appendix B: Epley Maneuver Protocol (Right Posterior Canal BPPV)

*For LEFT posterior canal BPPV, mirror all directions*

1. **Starting position:** Patient sitting on exam table, head turned 45° to the RIGHT
2. **Position 1:** Rapidly lay patient back with head hanging over edge of table, still turned 45° right (Dix-Hallpike position); wait 30 seconds (or until nystagmus stops)
3. **Position 2:** Rotate head 90° to the LEFT (now 45° left of midline); wait 30 seconds
4. **Position 3:** Roll patient onto LEFT side, rotating head another 90° so nose points toward floor; wait 30 seconds
5. **Position 4:** Slowly bring patient up to sitting position, keeping head turned left
6. **Finally:** Turn head back to midline

**Post-procedure:**
- May rest for a few minutes
- Sleep with head elevated 45° for 1-2 nights (controversial but commonly recommended)
- Avoid lying on affected side for 1 week
- May need repeat maneuver if symptoms persist

### Appendix C: Dix-Hallpike Maneuver Protocol

**Purpose:** Diagnose posterior canal BPPV

1. Patient sitting on exam table
2. Turn patient's head 45° toward the side being tested (e.g., RIGHT)
3. While supporting head, rapidly lay patient backward with head hanging 20-30° below table edge
4. Observe eyes for nystagmus

**Positive result for RIGHT posterior canal BPPV:**
- Upbeating-torsional nystagmus (top of eye beats upward and toward the RIGHT ear)
- Latency: 2-20 seconds before nystagmus appears
- Duration: <60 seconds (typically 10-40 seconds)
- Fatigable: decreases with repetition
- Patient experiences vertigo

**If positive:** Proceed immediately to Epley maneuver

**Caution:** Modify technique for cervical spine disease (use side-lying Dix-Hallpike)

### Appendix D: Vestibular Rehabilitation Exercises (Home Instructions)

**GAZE STABILIZATION EXERCISES (for vestibular hypofunction)**

*Exercise 1 (VOR x 1):*
- Hold a business card at arm's length with a word or letter on it
- Keep the card still and move your head side to side while keeping the word in focus
- Start slowly, gradually increase speed
- 1-2 minutes, 3-5 times daily

*Exercise 2 (VOR x 2):*
- Move both the card and your head in opposite directions
- Keep the word in focus
- More challenging; progress when VOR x 1 is easy

**BALANCE EXERCISES**

*Standing balance progression:*
1. Feet together, eyes open → eyes closed
2. Semi-tandem stance (heel touching arch), eyes open → eyes closed
3. Tandem stance (heel to toe), eyes open → eyes closed
4. Single leg stance, eyes open → eyes closed

*Hold each position 30-60 seconds; use wall for safety*

**BRANDT-DAROFF EXERCISES (for residual BPPV symptoms)**

1. Sit on edge of bed
2. Quickly lie down on RIGHT side with head turned 45° upward; wait 30 seconds
3. Return to sitting; wait 30 seconds
4. Quickly lie down on LEFT side with head turned 45° upward; wait 30 seconds
5. Return to sitting
6. Repeat 10-20 times, 3 times daily

### Appendix E: When to Use Each Test

| Clinical Scenario | Primary Test |
|------------------|--------------|
| **Acute continuous vertigo + nystagmus** (acute vestibular syndrome) | HINTS exam |
| **Episodic positional vertigo** (triggered by rolling over, looking up) | Dix-Hallpike maneuver |
| **Episodic vertigo + hearing loss/tinnitus/aural fullness** | Audiometry; consider Meniere's |
| **Episodic vertigo + headache/migraine features** | Headache diary; consider vestibular migraine |
| **Presyncope / lightheadedness with standing** | Orthostatic vital signs; ECG; Holter |
| **Chronic non-specific dizziness** | Full vestibular testing (VNG); consider PPPD; psychology eval |
