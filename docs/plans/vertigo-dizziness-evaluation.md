|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| **AVOID: Vestibular suppressants >72h** | PO | Meclizine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine, scopolamine — chronic use | N/A :: - :: N/A :: Vestibular suppressants delay central compensation; limit to 72h maximum in acute vertigo; do NOT prescribe chronically; NEVER for BPPV | - | Prolonged use leads to chronic imbalance and delayed recovery; taper and discontinue by day 3 | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| **AVOID: Chronic benzodiazepines for vertigo** | PO | Diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam — chronic vestibular use | N/A :: - :: N/A :: Benzodiazepines strongly suppress vestibular compensation; acceptable for 24-72h acute use only; chronic use causes dependence, cognitive impairment, fall risk | - | Taper if already on chronic benzodiazepines; refer to vestibular rehabilitation instead | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| **CAUTION: Ototoxic medications** | Various | Aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin); loop diuretics (furosemide); high-dose salicylates; cisplatin | N/A :: - :: N/A :: Can cause or worsen vestibular dysfunction and hearing loss; if must use, monitor levels closely; aminoglycosides preferentially damage vestibular apparatus | Use alternative antibiotics when possible; monitor drug levels | Audiometry; vestibular function; drug levels (aminoglycosides); hearing symptoms | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| **CAUTION: Medications causing orthostatic hypotension** | Various | Antihypertensives, alpha-blockers, diuretics, tricyclics, phenothiazines | N/A :: - :: N/A :: Orthostatic dizziness mimics vestibular vertigo; review all medications that lower blood pressure; dose-adjust or change timing | - | Orthostatic vital signs; medication reconciliation; consider dose reduction | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| **CAUTION: Alcohol** | PO | Alcohol consumption during vestibular recovery | N/A :: - :: N/A :: Alcohol is directly vestibulotoxic (positional alcohol nystagmus); impairs vestibular compensation; exacerbates Meniere's disease | - | Counsel abstinence during acute vestibular recovery; limit in Meniere's disease | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| **CAUTION: CNS depressants** | Various | Opioids, sedative-hypnotics, muscle relaxants, first-generation antihistamines | N/A :: - :: N/A :: CNS depressants impair vestibular compensation; increase fall risk; can worsen dizziness symptoms; minimize use during vestibular recovery | - | Fall risk assessment; minimize concurrent CNS depressant use; prefer non-sedating alternatives | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

### Dizziness Classification

| Type | Description | Common Causes |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Vertigo** | Illusion of movement (usually spinning); room spinning or self-spinning | BPPV, vestibular neuritis, Meniere's disease, vestibular migraine, posterior circulation stroke |
| **Presyncope / Lightheadedness** | Feeling of impending faint; "graying out" | Orthostatic hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, vasovagal syncope, dehydration |
| **Disequilibrium / Imbalance** | Unsteadiness; difficulty walking; feeling off-balance without spinning | Peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar disorders, bilateral vestibular loss, Parkinson's disease, cervical spondylosis |
| **Non-specific dizziness** | Vague lightheadedness, floating, difficulty concentrating | Anxiety/panic disorder, depression, hyperventilation, medication side effects, PPPD |

### Peripheral vs. Central Vertigo

| Feature | Peripheral | Central |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Onset** | Sudden | Sudden or gradual |
| **Severity** | Often severe; patient feels terrible | Variable; may be mild |
| **Nystagmus** | Unidirectional, horizontal-torsional; suppressed by visual fixation | Direction-changing, vertical, or purely torsional; NOT suppressed by fixation |
| **Head impulse test** | Abnormal (catch-up saccade) | Normal (no saccade) |
| **Skew deviation** | Absent | May be present |
| **Hearing loss** | May have (labyrinthitis, Meniere's) | Rare (unless AICA stroke) |
| **Other neuro signs** | Absent | May have (diplopia, dysarthria, ataxia, weakness, numbness) |
| **Gait** | Can usually walk (with difficulty) | May be unable to walk (severe ataxia) |
| **Imbalance severity** | Moderate | Severe (falling toward one side) |
| **Associated symptoms** | Nausea/vomiting (severe); tinnitus; ear fullness (Meniere's) | Headache (dissection, migraine); diplopia; dysphagia; limb weakness/numbness |

### HINTS Exam Interpretation

| Component | Peripheral (Safe) Pattern | Central (Dangerous) Pattern |
|-----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Head Impulse** | ABNORMAL (corrective saccade) | NORMAL (no saccade) |
| **Nystagmus** | Unidirectional (fast phase always beats same direction) | Direction-changing (beats right on right gaze, left on left gaze) OR vertical OR purely torsional |
| **Test of Skew** | Negative (no vertical misalignment) | Positive (eyes at different heights; covered eye moves when uncovered) |

**INFARCT Mnemonic:** **I**mpulse **N**ormal, **F**ast-phase **A**lternating, **R**efixation on cover **T**est = Central pattern = Consider stroke

### Common Peripheral Vestibular Disorders

| Disorder | Duration | Features | Treatment |
|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **BPPV** | Seconds (<1 min); triggered by position | Positional (rolling over, looking up); positive Dix-Hallpike; no hearing loss; latency; fatigable | Epley maneuver |
| **Vestibular neuritis** | Hours to days; continuous | Acute continuous vertigo; positive head impulse test; no hearing loss; horizontal nystagmus | Steroids; short-term suppressants; vestibular rehab |
| **Labyrinthitis** | Hours to days; continuous | Same as vestibular neuritis + hearing loss | Same as vestibular neuritis + possible antivirals |
| **Meniere's disease** | 20 min to hours; episodic | Episodic vertigo + fluctuating hearing loss + tinnitus + aural fullness; low-frequency hearing loss on audiometry | Low-sodium diet; diuretics; intratympanic therapy if refractory |
| **Vestibular migraine** | Minutes to hours; episodic | Associated with migraine features (headache before/during/after; photophobia; phonophobia); migraine history | Migraine preventives; triptans for acute |
| **Superior semicircular canal dehiscence** | Variable | Sound-induced or pressure-induced vertigo (Tullio/Hennebert sign); autophony; conductive hyperacusis; dehiscence on CT | Avoid triggers; surgical plugging if disabling |

### Red Flags for Central Cause ("DOs and DON'Ts")

| Red Flag | Concern |
|----------|---------|
| **D**iplopia, **D**ysarthria, **D**ysphagia | Brainstem involvement |
| **O**ther neuro signs (weakness, numbness, ataxia) | Brainstem/cerebellar stroke |
| **N**ormal head impulse test in acute vestibular syndrome | Central lesion |
| **D**irection-changing nystagmus | Central pattern |
| **V**ertical or purely torsional nystagmus | Central pattern |
| Sudden severe headache or neck pain | Vertebral artery dissection |
| Unable to walk (severe truncal ataxia) | Cerebellar lesion |
| Skew deviation | Brainstem lesion |
| **A**cute hearing loss without typical Meniere's features | AICA stroke (involves labyrinth) |

## APPENDICES

### Appendix A: HINTS Exam Protocol

**Prerequisites:**
- Patient has **ACUTE VESTIBULAR SYNDROME**: Continuous vertigo >24h, nausea/vomiting, nystagmus, gait instability
- Patient has SPONTANEOUS nystagmus visible at rest or with fixation removed
- Examiner is trained in performing and interpreting HINTS

**1. HEAD IMPULSE TEST (HIT)**
- Patient fixates on examiner's nose
- Examiner holds patient's head and delivers small, rapid, unpredictable horizontal head turns (10-20°)
- **NORMAL (dangerous):** Eyes stay on target without corrective saccade
- **ABNORMAL (reassuring):** Corrective saccade back to target after head turn (eyes "catch up")

**2. NYSTAGMUS EVALUATION**
- Observe spontaneous nystagmus in primary gaze
- Then observe in right gaze and left gaze
- **PERIPHERAL (reassuring):** Unidirectional — fast phase always beats the same direction regardless of gaze
- **CENTRAL (dangerous):** Direction-changing — fast phase beats right on right gaze, left on left gaze; OR vertical; OR purely torsional

**3. TEST OF SKEW (Alternate Cover Test)**
- Patient fixates on target
- Cover one eye, then quickly move cover to other eye
- Watch for vertical correction movement of uncovered eye
- **NEGATIVE (reassuring):** No vertical movement
- **POSITIVE (dangerous):** Vertical refixation (eye moves up or down when uncovered)

**Interpretation:**
- **ALL THREE peripheral pattern = Peripheral vestibular lesion** (vestibular neuritis)
- **ANY ONE central pattern = Central lesion likely** → Urgent MRI, stroke workup

### Appendix B: Epley Maneuver Protocol (Right Posterior Canal BPPV)

*For LEFT posterior canal BPPV, mirror all directions*

1. **Starting position:** Patient sitting on exam table, head turned 45° to the RIGHT
2. **Position 1:** Rapidly lay patient back with head hanging over edge of table, still turned 45° right (Dix-Hallpike position); wait 30 seconds (or until nystagmus stops)
3. **Position 2:** Rotate head 90° to the LEFT (now 45° left of midline); wait 30 seconds
4. **Position 3:** Roll patient onto LEFT side, rotating head another 90° so nose points toward floor; wait 30 seconds
5. **Position 4:** Slowly bring patient up to sitting position, keeping head turned left
6. **Finally:** Turn head back to midline

**Post-procedure:**
- May rest for a few minutes
- Sleep with head elevated 45° for 1-2 nights (controversial but commonly recommended)
- Avoid lying on affected side for 1 week
- May need repeat maneuver if symptoms persist

### Appendix C: Dix-Hallpike Maneuver Protocol

**Purpose:** Diagnose posterior canal BPPV

1. Patient sitting on exam table
2. Turn patient's head 45° toward the side being tested (e.g., RIGHT)
3. While supporting head, rapidly lay patient backward with head hanging 20-30° below table edge
4. Observe eyes for nystagmus

**Positive result for RIGHT posterior canal BPPV:**
- Upbeating-torsional nystagmus (top of eye beats upward and toward the RIGHT ear)
- Latency: 2-20 seconds before nystagmus appears
- Duration: <60 seconds (typically 10-40 seconds)
- Fatigable: decreases with repetition
- Patient experiences vertigo

**If positive:** Proceed immediately to Epley maneuver

**Caution:** Modify technique for cervical spine disease (use side-lying Dix-Hallpike)

### Appendix D: Vestibular Rehabilitation Exercises (Home Instructions)

**GAZE STABILIZATION EXERCISES (for vestibular hypofunction)**

*Exercise 1 (VOR x 1):*
- Hold a business card at arm's length with a word or letter on it
- Keep the card still and move your head side to side while keeping the word in focus
- Start slowly, gradually increase speed
- 1-2 minutes, 3-5 times daily

*Exercise 2 (VOR x 2):*
- Move both the card and your head in opposite directions
- Keep the word in focus
- More challenging; progress when VOR x 1 is easy

**BALANCE EXERCISES**

*Standing balance progression:*
1. Feet together, eyes open → eyes closed
2. Semi-tandem stance (heel touching arch), eyes open → eyes closed
3. Tandem stance (heel to toe), eyes open → eyes closed
4. Single leg stance, eyes open → eyes closed

*Hold each position 30-60 seconds; use wall for safety*

**BRANDT-DAROFF EXERCISES (for residual BPPV symptoms)**

1. Sit on edge of bed
2. Quickly lie down on RIGHT side with head turned 45° upward; wait 30 seconds
3. Return to sitting; wait 30 seconds
4. Quickly lie down on LEFT side with head turned 45° upward; wait 30 seconds
5. Return to sitting
6. Repeat 10-20 times, 3 times daily

### Appendix E: When to Use Each Test

| Clinical Scenario | Primary Test |
|------------------|--------------|
| **Acute continuous vertigo + nystagmus** (acute vestibular syndrome) | HINTS exam |
| **Episodic positional vertigo** (triggered by rolling over, looking up) | Dix-Hallpike maneuver |
| **Episodic vertigo + hearing loss/tinnitus/aural fullness** | Audiometry; consider Meniere's |
| **Episodic vertigo + headache/migraine features** | Headache diary; consider vestibular migraine |
| **Presyncope / lightheadedness with standing** | Orthostatic vital signs; ECG; Holter |
| **Chronic non-specific dizziness** | Full vestibular testing (VNG); consider PPPD; psychology eval |
