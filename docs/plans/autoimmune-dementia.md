**SYNONYMS:** autoimmune dementia, autoimmune encephalopathy, autoimmune cognitive disorder, antibody-mediated encephalitis, antibody-mediated dementia, rapidly progressive dementia — autoimmune, treatable dementia, autoimmune rapidly progressive cognitive decline, immune-mediated encephalopathy, steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT/Hashimoto encephalopathy)

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of autoimmune-mediated cognitive decline and encephalopathy. This is a "must-not-miss" diagnosis — autoimmune dementia is one of the few truly treatable and potentially reversible causes of dementia and rapidly progressive cognitive decline. Covers antibody-mediated encephalitis (NMDAR, LGI1, CASPR2, AMPAR, GABA-B, DPPX), paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis, and seronegative autoimmune encephalopathy. Includes rapid diagnostic workup, empiric immunotherapy, cancer screening, and long-term maintenance. Applies to all clinical settings.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Autoimmune dementia:** Subacute cognitive decline (weeks to months) caused by autoimmune-mediated CNS inflammation; potentially reversible with immunotherapy; may present as rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) or as slowly progressive dementia mimicking neurodegenerative disease
- **Autoimmune encephalitis:** Broader syndrome of autoimmune CNS inflammation presenting with encephalopathy (altered consciousness, personality change, cognitive decline), often with seizures, psychiatric symptoms, movement disorders; many cases overlap with autoimmune dementia
- **Cell-surface/synaptic antibodies:** Antibodies targeting proteins on the neuronal surface or synapse (NMDAR, LGI1, CASPR2, AMPAR, GABA-B, DPPX, GABA-A, IgLON5, mGluR5); generally more responsive to immunotherapy; may or may not be paraneoplastic
- **Intracellular/nuclear antibodies:** Antibodies targeting intracellular neuronal proteins (Hu/ANNA-1, Yo/PCA-1, CV2/CRMP5, Ma2, amphiphysin, GAD65 at high titers); almost always paraneoplastic; less responsive to immunotherapy (neuronal damage is T-cell mediated)
- **Paraneoplastic encephalitis:** Autoimmune encephalitis triggered by an underlying malignancy; tumor expresses neuronal proteins, provoking an immune cross-reaction
- **Rapidly progressive dementia (RPD):** Cognitive decline from normal to dementia within <1-2 years; differential includes prion disease (CJD), autoimmune, infectious, toxic-metabolic, vascular, neoplastic, and neurodegenerative causes
- **Seronegative autoimmune encephalitis:** Clinical and paraclinical features strongly suggestive of autoimmune encephalitis, but all known antibody panels are negative; still may respond to immunotherapy; diagnosis of exclusion
- **SREAT (Hashimoto encephalopathy):** Encephalopathy with elevated anti-TPO and/or anti-thyroglobulin antibodies; steroid-responsive; controversial entity — antibodies may be incidental rather than pathogenic; now often considered a subset of seronegative autoimmune encephalitis

## Section 2: Diagnostic Imaging & Studies

### 2A — Essential Imaging

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|
| MRI brain with/without contrast (thin-cut temporal, FLAIR, DWI, T2, post-gad) | STAT | STAT | URGENT | STAT | **First-line and most important imaging** — T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in mesial temporal lobes (hippocampus, amygdala) is classic for limbic encephalitis; DWI cortical ribboning suggests CJD; enhancement patterns vary by antibody type; may be normal in up to 30% of autoimmune encephalitis |
| EEG (routine or continuous) | URGENT | URGENT | ROUTINE | STAT | Seizures (often subclinical), extreme delta brush (pathognomonic for anti-NMDAR encephalitis), periodic discharges (CJD), diffuse slowing (encephalopathy); continuous EEG in ICU patients |
| CT head without contrast | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | Rapid screening in ED to exclude mass, hemorrhage, hydrocephalus; MRI is ultimately needed |
| Chest X-ray | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | Malignancy screening (lung cancer — Hu, CRMP5); infection |

### 2B — Extended Imaging — Cancer Screening

> **All patients with confirmed or suspected autoimmune encephalitis require malignancy screening.** The specific cancer screen depends on the antibody identified.

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|
| CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast | - | URGENT | URGENT | URGENT | Comprehensive cancer screening — lung (SCLC → Hu, CRMP5, AMPAR), ovarian teratoma (NMDAR), thymoma (CASPR2, LGI1), lymphoma, renal |
| Pelvic/transvaginal ultrasound (females) | - | URGENT | URGENT | URGENT | Ovarian teratoma screening — **mandatory in anti-NMDAR encephalitis** in women; teratoma removal is therapeutic; may require MRI pelvis if US inconclusive |
| Testicular ultrasound (males <50) | - | URGENT | URGENT | URGENT | Testicular tumor screening in young males with anti-NMDAR or Ma2 antibodies |
| PET/CT (whole body) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | Most sensitive for occult malignancy when CT is negative; particularly useful for paraneoplastic antibodies with intracellular targets (Hu, Yo, Ma2) |
| MRI pelvis | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | If ovarian teratoma suspected but US inconclusive |
| Mammography / breast MRI | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | If amphiphysin antibody positive — associated with breast cancer |

### 2C — Rare/Specialized Studies

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|
| FDG-PET brain | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Hypermetabolism in medial temporal lobes (limbic encephalitis) vs hypometabolism (neurodegenerative); can be positive when MRI is normal |
| Brain biopsy | - | EXT | - | EXT | Last resort — only if all other investigations negative and progressive decline; rule out CNS vasculitis, lymphoma, CJD; high morbidity; should target area of abnormality on MRI |
| Conventional cerebral angiography | - | EXT | - | EXT | If primary CNS vasculitis suspected (beading pattern); can be normal in small vessel vasculitis |
| Neuropsychological testing | - | - | ROUTINE | - | Document cognitive profile, track treatment response, differentiate from neurodegenerative patterns; LGI1 typically limbic (amnesia); NMDAR often frontal-subcortical |

## Section 3: Treatment

> **CRITICAL: Time is brain.** Autoimmune encephalitis and autoimmune dementia are medical emergencies when progressive. Earlier immunotherapy is associated with better outcomes. Do NOT wait for antibody results to initiate empiric treatment if clinical suspicion is moderate-to-high. The Graus criteria (2016) allow for initiation of immunotherapy based on "possible autoimmune encephalitis" criteria.

### 3A — Acute / First-Line Immunotherapy

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |

### 3D — Tumor Treatment (Paraneoplastic Cases)

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Tumor resection/treatment | - | Essential in all paraneoplastic cases; neurologic improvement is unlikely without tumor treatment | Ovarian teratoma removal (anti-NMDAR); SCLC treatment (chemo/radiation); thymectomy for thymoma-associated cases | - | Post-operative neurologic status; antibody titers post-resection | - | URGENT | URGENT | URGENT |

| Brivaracetam | PO/IV | Alternative to levetiracetam with potentially fewer psychiatric side effects | 25-100 mg :: PO/IV :: BID | - | - | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |

> **Important:** Seizures in autoimmune encephalitis are driven by the underlying autoimmune process. Immunotherapy is the definitive seizure treatment — ASMs are adjunctive. Refractory seizures should prompt escalation of immunotherapy, not just addition of more ASMs.

## Section 4: Other Recommendations

### 4A — Referrals

| Referral | Setting | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Neuroimmunology / autoimmune neurology | HOSP/OPD | Specialized management of autoimmune encephalitis; immunotherapy selection and monitoring; long-term relapse prevention |
| Oncology | HOSP/OPD | All paraneoplastic cases — tumor staging, treatment planning; gynecologic oncology for teratoma |
| Epileptology | HOSP/OPD | Refractory seizures, continuous EEG interpretation, ASM optimization |
| Psychiatry | HOSP/OPD | Psychiatric manifestations (especially NMDAR encephalitis — frequently misdiagnosed as primary psychiatric illness); capacity evaluation |
| Neuropsychology | OPD | Baseline and follow-up cognitive testing to document treatment response |
| Rehabilitation (PT/OT/SLP) | HOSP/OPD | Cognitive rehabilitation, motor recovery, speech/swallowing if affected |
| Social work / case management | HOSP/OPD | Insurance navigation (IVIG/rituximab are expensive — prior authorization), disability applications, caregiver support |

### 4B — Patient and Family Instructions

- **Explain the diagnosis:** This is an immune system attack on the brain that causes memory loss and confusion — unlike Alzheimer's disease, it is potentially treatable and sometimes reversible with immune-suppressing medications
- **Treatment expectations:** Improvement may be gradual over weeks to months — some patients continue to improve for 1-2 years after treatment; recovery is often incomplete but functional improvement is possible
- **Medication adherence:** Immunotherapy and seizure medications must be taken consistently; stopping immunotherapy risks relapse
- **Relapse signs:** Return of confusion, memory loss, personality changes, seizures, movement abnormalities — seek immediate medical attention
- **Cancer screening importance:** Even if initial cancer screening is negative, follow-up imaging is essential because tumors may be small and emerge later
- **Infection risk:** Immunosuppressive medications increase infection susceptibility — report any fever, cough, unusual symptoms promptly; avoid live vaccines
- **Driving and safety:** Cognitive impairment, seizures, and psychiatric symptoms may preclude safe driving — formal evaluation needed before return to driving
- **Advance care planning:** Discuss goals of care, particularly if response to immunotherapy is limited

### 4C — Lifestyle and Supportive Measures

- **Cognitive rehabilitation:** Structured cognitive therapy programs can augment recovery alongside immunotherapy
- **Exercise:** Regular physical activity — evidence supports benefit for cognitive function and mood; cleared by treating physician
- **Nutrition:** Balanced diet; address any vitamin deficiencies identified in workup
- **Sleep optimization:** Treat insomnia aggressively — sleep disruption worsens cognitive symptoms
- **Psychosocial support:** Support groups for autoimmune encephalitis (Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance); family counseling
- **Vaccination review:** Ensure age-appropriate vaccinations (non-live) are current before immunosuppression; no live vaccines during immunosuppressive therapy

## Section 5: Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Key Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)** | Most important differential in RPD — rapidly progressive (weeks-months), myoclonus, startle, cerebellar ataxia; DWI cortical ribboning and basal ganglia restriction on MRI; periodic sharp wave complexes on EEG; RT-QuIC >90% specific; no treatment; must exclude before immunotherapy delays diagnosis |
| **Alzheimer disease (AD)** | Slow progressive (years), amnestic presentation, posterior cortical atrophy variant; CSF Aβ42 low, p-tau high; no inflammatory CSF; MRI shows hippocampal atrophy without T2 signal change |
| **Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)** | Behavioral or language variant; progressive over years; frontal/temporal atrophy; no inflammatory markers; no antibodies |
| **Viral encephalitis (HSV, VZV)** | Acute onset, fever, CSF pleocytosis with elevated protein; HSV-1 → temporal lobe predilection (mimics limbic encephalitis); PCR diagnostic; acyclovir treatment; **NMDAR encephalitis can follow HSV encephalitis** (post-HSV autoimmune encephalitis — important entity) |
| **CNS vasculitis (primary or secondary)** | Headache, stroke-like episodes, CSF pleocytosis; multifocal ischemic lesions on MRI; angiography may show beading; biopsy may be needed; treat with cyclophosphamide + steroids |
| **Neurosarcoidosis** | Cranial neuropathies, hypothalamic dysfunction, leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI; elevated ACE; biopsy shows granulomas; responds to steroids |
| **CNS lymphoma** | Periventricular enhancing lesions, CSF cytology/flow positive; may mimic autoimmune; biopsy often needed |
| **Hashimoto encephalopathy (SREAT)** | Elevated anti-TPO, steroid-responsive encephalopathy; controversial whether this is a distinct entity or seronegative autoimmune encephalitis; treat empirically as autoimmune |
| **Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy** | Drug toxicity, hepatic encephalopathy, uremic encephalopathy, severe electrolyte derangements; history and labs differentiate |
| **Seizure-related cognitive decline (NORSE/FIRES)** | New-onset refractory status epilepticus — may be autoimmune-mediated; aggressive EEG monitoring needed |
| **Neurodegenerative with Lewy bodies (DLB)** | Fluctuations, visual hallucinations, RBD, parkinsonism; slow progressive; DaTscan positive; no inflammatory CSF |

---

## Section 6: Monitoring Parameters

| Parameter | Frequency | Target/Goal |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Cognitive assessment (MoCA, MMSE, or neuropsychological battery)** | Baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, then annually | Improvement in cognitive scores — objective documentation of treatment response; plateau or decline prompts re-evaluation |
| **Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)** | Each visit | Functional improvement; target mRS 0-2 (good outcome) |
| **Antibody titers (serum and/or CSF)** | 3-6 months after treatment initiation; then every 6-12 months | Declining titers support treatment response; rising titers suggest relapse or inadequate treatment; seronegative patients — monitor clinically |
| **MRI brain** | 3-6 months after treatment, then as clinically indicated | Resolution of T2/FLAIR signal; development of hippocampal atrophy may indicate permanent damage |
| **EEG** | As clinically indicated (seizures, encephalopathy) | Resolution of epileptiform activity; no nonconvulsive status |
| **CBC, CMP** | Every 2-4 weeks during induction; monthly during maintenance | Immunosuppression monitoring — leukopenia, hepatotoxicity, renal function |
| **Immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, IgM)** | Every 6 months (if on rituximab or IVIG) | Hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG <400 → increased infection risk → consider IgG replacement) |
| **CD19/CD20 B-cell count** | Every 3-6 months (if on rituximab) | B-cell depletion adequacy; guide retreatment timing |
| **Cancer screening imaging** | Every 6 months x 2 years, then annually x 3 years | Occult tumor detection — especially if paraneoplastic antibodies confirmed but initial screening negative |
| **Bone density (DEXA)** | Baseline and annually if on chronic steroids | Osteoporosis prevention — start calcium, vitamin D, consider bisphosphonate |

## Notes

- **"Treatable" does not always mean "curable"** — while autoimmune dementia is one of the most important treatable causes of cognitive decline, recovery depends on timing of treatment, antibody type, and degree of neuronal injury at presentation. Early treatment is associated with best outcomes. Some patients have permanent sequelae despite aggressive immunotherapy.
- **Post-HSV autoimmune encephalitis** — NMDAR antibodies can develop 2-12 weeks after HSV encephalitis, particularly in children. Any patient with clinical relapse after HSV treatment should be tested for NMDAR antibodies before retreating with acyclovir.
- **Seronegative cases** — Up to 20-30% of clinically probable autoimmune encephalitis has negative antibody panels. This does not exclude the diagnosis. If the clinical picture is consistent (subacute onset, CSF pleocytosis, MRI mesial temporal signal, seizures, treatment response), empiric immunotherapy is appropriate.
- **GAD65 antibodies at high titer** — GAD65 antibodies are found in type 1 diabetes and can be incidentally elevated. Only high titers (>20 nmol/L or >10x upper limit of normal) are clinically significant for autoimmune neurologic disease (stiff person spectrum, limbic encephalitis, epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia).
- **NMDAR encephalitis presentation pattern** — Classic sequence (especially in young women): psychiatric symptoms → seizures → movement disorder (orofacial dyskinesias) → autonomic instability → decreased consciousness. Many patients initially present to psychiatry and are misdiagnosed; have a low threshold for CSF NMDAR antibody testing in young patients with new-onset psychiatric symptoms.
- **Cancer surveillance is longitudinal** — A negative initial cancer screen does not rule out occult malignancy, particularly with intracellular antibodies. Follow-up imaging at 6-month intervals for at least 2 years, then annually for up to 5 years, is standard of care.
- **Cost and access barriers** — IVIG and rituximab are expensive therapies often requiring prior authorization. Social work and case management involvement early is essential. Patient assistance programs are available for most biologic agents.
- **The Graus 2016 criteria** provide a framework for "possible," "probable," and "definite" autoimmune encephalitis — importantly, "possible" autoimmune encephalitis criteria are sufficient to initiate empiric immunotherapy while awaiting antibody results.
