**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Cluster Headache:** Primary headache disorder with severe unilateral orbital/supraorbital/temporal pain lasting 15-180 minutes, occurring 1-8 times daily, with ipsilateral autonomic features
- **Episodic Cluster Headache:** Cluster periods lasting 7 days to 1 year, separated by pain-free remissions of ≥3 months
- **Chronic Cluster Headache:** Attacks occur for >1 year without remission, or remissions lasting <3 months
- **Cluster Period (Bout):** Period of weeks to months during which attacks occur
- **Trigeminal Autonomic Cephalalgias (TACs):** Group of primary headaches with trigeminal pain and autonomic features (cluster, paroxysmal hemicrania, SUNCT/SUNA, hemicrania continua)

---

**DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (ICHD-3):**

**A.** At least 5 attacks fulfilling criteria B-D
**B.** Severe or very severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, and/or temporal pain lasting 15-180 minutes (untreated)
**C.** Either or both:
  1. At least one ipsilateral autonomic symptom: conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, forehead/facial sweating, miosis, ptosis, eyelid edema
  2. Sense of restlessness or agitation
**D.** Attacks occur between 1 every other day and 8 per day
**E.** Not better accounted for by another diagnosis

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Migraine | Longer duration (4-72h), bilateral possible, photophobia/phonophobia, prefers rest vs restlessness | Clinical criteria (ICHD-3) |
| Paroxysmal hemicrania | Shorter attacks (2-30 min), higher frequency (>5/day), ABSOLUTE response to indomethacin | Indomethacin trial (completely responsive) |
| SUNCT/SUNA | Very short attacks (1-600 sec), very high frequency, conjunctival injection/tearing | Clinical criteria; shorter duration |
| Hemicrania continua | Continuous baseline pain with exacerbations, responds to indomethacin | Indomethacin trial |
| Trigeminal neuralgia | Electric shock-like, seconds duration, triggered by touch/chewing | MRI for neurovascular compression; much shorter attacks |
| Pituitary tumor | Visual field deficits, hormonal abnormalities, progressive | MRI pituitary |
| Cavernous sinus lesion | Persistent symptoms, cranial nerve palsies | MRI/MRA |
| Giant cell arteritis | Age >50, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, elevated ESR | ESR/CRP, temporal artery biopsy |
| Primary stabbing headache | Brief (seconds), random location, no autonomic features | Clinical |

## 6. MONITORING PARAMETERS

| Depression screening | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Each visit | Negative | Refer psychiatry |

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Disposition | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Discharge from ED | Attack aborted with O2/triptan, preventive medication initiated or adjusted, home O2 arranged, follow-up planned |
| Admit to hospital | Severe refractory attacks, need for IV DHE protocol, unable to manage at home, new diagnosis requiring workup |

## NOTES

- Cluster headache is one of the most severe pain conditions known ("suicide headache")
- Attacks have striking circadian and circannual periodicity
- Oxygen is FIRST-LINE abortive - very effective, no cardiovascular contraindications
- Sumatriptan SC is preferred over oral (onset too slow for short attacks)
- Verapamil is mainstay preventive; requires ECG monitoring for PR prolongation at higher doses
- Alcohol is a potent trigger DURING cluster period but not during remission
- Depression and suicidal ideation are common - screen actively
- Transitional therapy (steroids/GON block) provides bridge while preventive takes effect
- Galcanezumab (CGRP mAb) is FDA-approved for episodic cluster headache
- Distinguish from paroxysmal hemicrania (absolute indomethacin response) - trial if uncertain
