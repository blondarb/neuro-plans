# Non-REM Parasomnias

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** February 7, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Non-REM Parasomnias (Disorders of Arousal)

**ICD-10:** F51.3 (Sleepwalking [somnambulism]), F51.4 (Sleep terrors [night terrors]), G47.50 (Parasomnia, unspecified), G47.51 (Confusional arousals)

> **Coding Note:** Use F51.3 for confirmed sleepwalking and F51.4 for confirmed sleep terrors. G47.50 is appropriate when the specific parasomnia subtype is not yet determined. G47.52 (REM sleep behavior disorder) is a separate entity — see RBD plan.

**CPT CODES:** 95810 (Video-polysomnography (PSG)), 95717 (Extended EEG monitoring), 95816 (Routine EEG), 70553 (MRI brain with and without contrast), 85025 (CBC), 80053 (CMP), 84443 (TSH), 80307 (Urine drug screen), 82728 (Serum ferritin)

**SYNONYMS:** NREM parasomnias, disorders of arousal, sleepwalking, somnambulism, sleep terrors, night terrors, pavor nocturnus, confusional arousals, sleep drunkenness, sexsomnia, sleep-related eating disorder, overlap parasomnia

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis and management of non-REM parasomnias (disorders of arousal) in adults. Covers sleepwalking (somnambulism), sleep terrors (pavor nocturnus), confusional arousals, and related variants including sleep-related eating disorder and sexsomnia. Critical focus on differentiating from nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. Includes diagnostic workup, safety interventions, trigger management, and pharmacotherapy. Excludes REM sleep behavior disorder (separate plan), nightmare disorder, and pediatric-specific management.

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Non-REM Parasomnia (Disorder of Arousal):** A group of parasomnias arising from incomplete arousals out of NREM (typically N3/slow-wave) sleep, characterized by complex behaviors with impaired consciousness and subsequent amnesia
- **Sleepwalking (Somnambulism):** Complex ambulatory behaviors initiated during arousals from NREM sleep, ranging from sitting up in bed to walking, running, eating, or leaving the house
- **Sleep Terrors (Pavor Nocturnus):** Episodes of abrupt terror arousal from NREM sleep, typically with a piercing scream, intense fear, and autonomic activation (tachycardia, diaphoresis, mydriasis)
- **Confusional Arousals (Sleep Drunkenness):** Episodes of mental confusion during arousal from NREM (typically slow-wave) sleep; may include inappropriate behavior, slow speech, and reduced alertness without prominent ambulation or terror
- **Sexsomnia:** A variant of confusional arousal characterized by sexual behaviors during NREM sleep, with complete amnesia for the event
- **Sleep-Related Eating Disorder (SRED):** Recurrent episodes of involuntary eating during arousals from NREM sleep, often with consumption of unusual or inedible substances
- **Overlap Parasomnia:** Co-occurrence of NREM parasomnia features with REM sleep behavior disorder in the same patient
- **Slow-Wave Sleep (N3):** The deepest stage of NREM sleep, characterized by high-amplitude delta waves on EEG; predominates in the first third of the night

---

**DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (ICSD-3-TR):**

**Disorders of Arousal — General Criteria (All of the following):**

1. Recurrent episodes of incomplete awakening from sleep
2. Inappropriate or absent responsiveness to efforts of others to intervene or redirect the person during the episode
3. Limited (e.g., a single visual scene) or no associated cognition or dream imagery
4. Partial or complete amnesia for the episode
5. The disturbance is not better explained by another sleep disorder, mental disorder, medical condition, medication, or substance use

**Sleepwalking — Additional Criteria:**
- Complex behaviors arising from arousals during NREM sleep, typically from slow-wave sleep
- Behaviors may include sitting up, walking, running, eating, leaving the house, or driving
- Eyes are typically open with a glassy stare; individual is difficult to awaken

**Sleep Terrors — Additional Criteria:**
- Episodes of abrupt terror arousal from NREM sleep, usually initiated by a piercing scream or cry
- Intense fear and signs of autonomic arousal including tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, and mydriasis
- Relative unresponsiveness to efforts of others to comfort the individual during the episode

**Confusional Arousals — Additional Criteria:**
- Episodes of mental confusion or confusional behavior during arousal from NREM sleep (typically slow-wave sleep)
- May include slow speech, confused thinking, inappropriate behavior, or poor reactivity to external stimuli
- Absence of prominent ambulation (distinguishes from sleepwalking) or prominent terror/autonomic activation (distinguishes from sleep terrors)

**Key Epidemiologic Features:**
- Sleepwalking: prevalence ~1-4% in adults; ~17% in children
- Sleep terrors: prevalence ~2% in adults; ~3-6% in children
- Confusional arousals: prevalence ~4% in adults
- All disorders of arousal are more common in childhood and typically decrease with age
- Strong genetic predisposition: prevalence increases to ~45% if one parent affected, ~60% if both parents affected

**Predisposing and Precipitating Factors:**
- **Sleep deprivation** — strongest documented trigger (increases slow-wave sleep pressure)
- **Alcohol** — fragmentary arousals from NREM sleep
- **Febrile illness** — especially in children
- **Medications** — zolpidem, SSRIs, lithium, quetiapine, sodium oxybate
- **Comorbid sleep disorders** — OSA, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movements (increase arousal frequency)
- **Stress and anxiety** — increase NREM instability
- **Noise or environmental disruption** — forced arousals from N3

| Psychiatry referral if significant psychological stress, trauma, anxiety, or comorbid mood disorder is contributing to parasomnia frequency or severity | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Forensic sleep medicine evaluation if parasomnia events have medicolegal implications (violence during sleep, sexsomnia, injury to others, sleep-driving) | - | - | EXT | - |
| ENT / pulmonology if obstructive sleep apnea identified as arousal trigger requiring CPAP titration or surgical evaluation | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4B. Patient/Family Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| NREM parasomnias are a neurological condition caused by incomplete arousals from deep sleep; they are not a psychiatric disorder or sign of emotional disturbance | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Safety-proof the sleeping environment immediately: lock doors and windows, install alarms, remove sharp objects, place mattress on floor, secure weapons and car keys | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Do NOT forcefully restrain or attempt to aggressively wake someone during an episode; this may worsen agitation and risk injury; instead, gently guide the person back to bed and speak calmly | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Report any injuries to self or others occurring during episodes; escalating frequency, increasing violence, or new behaviors require urgent medical reassessment | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid sleep deprivation — this is the single strongest trigger; maintain a consistent sleep schedule even on weekends and holidays | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid alcohol within 3 hours of bedtime; alcohol is a potent trigger for NREM parasomnias | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Bed partners should sleep in a separate room if episodes involve violent or sexual behaviors until treatment is effective | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Record events on video (smartphone with night vision or infrared camera) whenever safely possible; video recordings are extremely valuable for diagnosis | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Maintain strict consistent sleep-wake schedule 7 days per week; sleep deprivation is the most potent and modifiable trigger for NREM parasomnias | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Stress reduction techniques including mindfulness, progressive muscle relaxation, or cognitive behavioral therapy; psychological stress increases NREM sleep instability | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid alcohol within 3 hours of bedtime; alcohol fragments NREM sleep and lowers the arousal threshold | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Regular moderate exercise (30 minutes daily) promotes consolidated sleep; avoid vigorous exercise within 2 hours of bedtime | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid heavy meals within 2 hours of bedtime; large meals may disrupt sleep architecture and increase arousals | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Review all medications with provider; common triggers include zolpidem, SSRIs, lithium, quetiapine, sodium oxybate, and beta-blockers | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid shift work when possible; irregular sleep schedules are a significant trigger for disorders of arousal | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Treat comorbid sleep disorders (OSA with CPAP, RLS with appropriate therapy) as these increase the arousal burden that triggers parasomnia events | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) / Sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) | KEY DIFFERENTIAL: highly stereotyped events; brief duration (typically <2 min); multiple events per night possible; hypermotor semiology (kicking, pedaling, thrashing); may retain awareness; can occur at any time of night; events cluster in NREM stage 2 | Video-PSG with extended EEG montage; routine EEG (may show frontal spikes/sharp waves); MRI brain (frontal cortical dysplasia); trial of carbamazepine (positive response supports epilepsy) |
| REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) | Occurs during REM sleep (second half of night); dream enactment with recall of vivid/violent dreams; typically older males >50; REM without atonia on PSG; associated with alpha-synucleinopathies (Parkinson, DLB, MSA) | Video-PSG showing REM without atonia; clinical history of dream recall and REM-timing events |
| Obstructive sleep apnea with confusional arousals | Pseudo-parasomnia triggered by respiratory arousals; snoring, witnessed apneas, obesity; events resolve with CPAP treatment | PSG with respiratory scoring (AHI >5); trial of CPAP with resolution of events |
| Nocturnal panic attacks | Full awakening with complete recall; subjective terror with palpitations, dyspnea, chest pain; daytime panic attacks also present; occurs from NREM stage 2-3 but patient is fully alert after | Psychiatric evaluation; presence of daytime panic disorder; full recall of event (vs. amnesia in parasomnias) |
| PTSD nightmares | Dream recall present; REM-associated; history of trauma; nightmares with thematic content related to traumatic experiences; full arousal with emotional recall | Psychiatric evaluation; trauma history; PSG shows events arise from REM; dream content recall |
| Dissociative disorder (nocturnal dissociative episodes) | Events arise from established wakefulness (not from sleep); normal EEG during events; prolonged episodes; history of trauma/abuse; events may occur with eyes open during wakefulness in bed | Video-PSG showing events arise from documented wakefulness (alpha EEG rhythm); psychiatric evaluation |
| Medication-induced parasomnia | Temporal relationship to medication initiation or dose change; common culprits: zolpidem (sleepwalking, sleep-driving), SSRIs, lithium, quetiapine, sodium oxybate | Medication review; temporal correlation; resolution with dose reduction or discontinuation |
| Nocturnal hypoglycemia | Diaphoresis, confusion, tremor; occurs in diabetic patients on insulin or sulfonylureas; blood glucose <70 mg/dL during events | Continuous glucose monitoring; fingerstick glucose during or immediately after event |
| Epileptic wandering (nonconvulsive status) | Prolonged confusional wandering; may have subtle ictal features (automatisms, lip smacking); postictal confusion | EEG during event showing seizure activity; response to antiseizure medications |

## NOTES

- NREM parasomnias arise from incomplete arousals out of slow-wave (N3) sleep, resulting in a dissociated state with motor activation but impaired consciousness and subsequent amnesia
- Events characteristically occur in the first third of the night when slow-wave sleep predominates
- Sleep deprivation is the single most potent and well-documented trigger — any factor that increases slow-wave sleep rebound (sleep deprivation, prior sleep disruption, recovery sleep) increases risk
- The critical clinical distinction is between NREM parasomnia and nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy); stereotyped brief events occurring multiple times per night strongly favor epilepsy
- Video-PSG with extended EEG montage is the diagnostic gold standard; capturing an event during the study provides definitive classification
- Normal interictal EEG does NOT exclude nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy; scalp EEG may miss deep frontal epileptiform activity in up to 40% of cases
- OSA is an underrecognized trigger: respiratory arousal events can trigger parasomnia episodes, and treating OSA with CPAP may completely resolve the parasomnia
- Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder similarly increase NREM arousal frequency and should be aggressively treated
- Clonazepam has the longest track record for NREM parasomnias but carries risks of tolerance, daytime sedation, and respiratory depression (particularly concerning if comorbid OSA)
- Melatonin is increasingly used as a safer first-line option, particularly in elderly patients or those with OSA, though evidence remains limited to case series
- Anti-IgLON5 disease is a rare autoimmune condition that should be considered in patients with NREM parasomnia plus additional neurological features (gait instability, bulbar dysfunction, cognitive decline)
- Sexsomnia and sleep-related violence carry significant medicolegal implications; forensic sleep medicine evaluation is indicated when events have legal consequences
- Overlap parasomnia (coexistence of NREM parasomnia with RBD) may suggest underlying neurodegenerative pathology and warrants longitudinal monitoring
- Medication-induced parasomnia is common and reversible: zolpidem is the most frequently implicated agent, but SSRIs, lithium, quetiapine, and sodium oxybate are also documented triggers
