# Parkinson's Disease — Motor Fluctuations and Dyskinesia

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** February 9, 2026
**REVISED:** February 9, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Parkinson's Disease — Motor Fluctuations and Dyskinesia

**ICD-10:** G20.A2 (Parkinson's disease without dyskinesia, with fluctuations), G20.B2 (Parkinson's disease with dyskinesia, with fluctuations), G20.A1 (Parkinson's disease without dyskinesia, without fluctuations), G20.B1 (Parkinson's disease with dyskinesia, without fluctuations), G24.02 (Drug-induced acute dystonia), G25.1 (Drug-induced tremor)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC), 80048 (BMP), 84443 (TSH), 82728 (Ferritin), 82607 (Vitamin B12), 80299 (Quantitative drug level — levodopa), 70553 (MRI brain with/without contrast), 78607 (DaTscan — brain SPECT for dopamine transporter), 95816 (EEG), 61863 (Deep brain stimulation implantation, first array), 64999 (Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel pump), 97110 (Therapeutic exercises), 90834 (Psychotherapy, 45 min)

**SYNONYMS:** PD motor fluctuations, wearing-off phenomenon, on-off phenomenon, off episodes, end-of-dose wearing off, levodopa-induced dyskinesia, peak-dose dyskinesia, diphasic dyskinesia, early morning dystonia, delayed on, dose failure, motor complications of PD, motor response complications

**SCOPE:** Management of motor fluctuations (wearing off, on-off fluctuations, delayed on, dose failures) and dyskinesia (peak-dose, diphasic, off-period dystonia) in established Parkinson's disease patients on dopaminergic therapy. Includes pharmacologic optimization, advanced therapies (DBS, pump therapies), and management of acute off-state emergencies. Excludes initial diagnosis and early management of PD (see Parkinson's Disease — New Diagnosis template), PD dementia, and PD psychosis (separate templates).

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Motor fluctuations:** Variations in motor response to levodopa therapy; include wearing off, on-off phenomena, delayed on, and dose failure
- **Wearing off (end-of-dose deterioration):** Predictable return of PD symptoms before the next levodopa dose is due; earliest and most common motor fluctuation; related to narrowing therapeutic window
- **On-off phenomenon:** Unpredictable, abrupt, and sometimes rapid shifts between mobile ("on") and immobile ("off") states not clearly related to levodopa dosing schedule
- **Peak-dose dyskinesia:** Involuntary choreiform movements occurring at peak levodopa plasma levels (typically 60-90 min after dose); most common form of dyskinesia
- **Diphasic dyskinesia:** Dyskinetic movements occurring at the beginning and end of levodopa dose cycle; often dystonic or repetitive; responds to sustained dopaminergic stimulation
- **Off-period dystonia:** Painful sustained muscle contraction (often foot/toe dystonia) occurring during "off" periods, especially early morning before first dose; reflects dopamine depletion
- **Delayed on / no-on (dose failure):** Prolonged time to onset of levodopa effect or complete failure of a dose to produce benefit; often related to protein competition for absorption or gastroparesis

## 4. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS

### 4A. Referrals & Consults

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Movement disorders specialist for optimization of fluctuations and dyskinesia; advanced therapy evaluation (DBS, pump therapies); complex medication management | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| DBS surgical team evaluation (neurosurgeon + movement disorders neurologist) if motor fluctuations or dyskinesia are refractory to optimized medical management and patient meets candidacy criteria | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Physical therapy for gait and balance training, fall prevention, exercise prescription (PD-specific programs: LSVT BIG, PWR! Moves, boxing, dance) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Speech therapy (LSVT LOUD) for hypophonia and speech clarity — common in advancing PD | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Occupational therapy for ADL strategies during off periods, adaptive equipment, and home safety assessment | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Psychiatry/psychology for depression, anxiety, impulse control disorders (associated with dopamine agonists), and adjustment to disease progression | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Nutrition/dietitian for protein redistribution diet (protein competes with levodopa for absorption); ensure adequate hydration and fiber for constipation management | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Take levodopa on time, every time — even small delays can trigger off episodes; set multiple alarms; bring medications to all appointments and hospital stays | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Take levodopa 30-60 minutes before meals or 1-2 hours after meals for best absorption — protein (amino acids) competes with levodopa for intestinal absorption; consider a protein redistribution diet (low protein during the day, larger protein serving at dinner) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Never stop PD medications abruptly — sudden discontinuation can cause neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome (hyperthermia, rigidity, autonomic instability, altered consciousness) which is life-threatening | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Keep an on/off motor diary for 1-2 weeks before each clinic visit — record time of each medication dose, hours of good mobility (on), hours of poor mobility (off), and hours of involuntary movements (dyskinesia) | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid medications that block dopamine: metoclopramide (Reglan), prochlorperazine (Compazine), promethazine (Phenergan), haloperidol, droperidol — these will dramatically worsen PD symptoms; use ondansetron for nausea (unless on apomorphine) or domperidone if available | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Exercise regularly (walking, cycling, boxing, dance, swimming) — exercise is neuroprotective and improves motor function, balance, and quality of life in PD | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Report new involuntary movements (dyskinesia), hallucinations, gambling/spending/sexual urges (impulse control disorders), or excessive daytime sleepiness to your movement disorders team | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Exercise 30-60 minutes daily, 5 days/week: PD-specific programs (LSVT BIG, Rock Steady Boxing, PD Warrior, dance for PD) provide greatest benefit; exercise is the most evidence-based lifestyle intervention for PD | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Protein redistribution diet: keep daytime protein intake low (20-30 g) to optimize levodopa absorption; consume remaining protein at evening meal when motor function is less critical | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Prevent falls: remove throw rugs; install grab bars; use nightlights; avoid carrying objects while walking; use assistive devices (cane, walker) when needed; address freezing of gait with cues (counting, laser pointer, metronome) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Maintain social engagement and cognitive stimulation — social isolation accelerates cognitive decline in PD; support groups, hobbies, and structured activities are beneficial | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Manage constipation proactively: high fiber diet (25-30 g/day), adequate hydration (2L/day), polyethylene glycol (Miralax) 17 g daily — constipation delays gastric emptying and worsens levodopa absorption | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Optimize sleep hygiene: consistent sleep/wake times; melatonin 3-5 mg for insomnia; treat REM sleep behavior disorder if present; good sleep improves daytime motor function | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Atypical parkinsonism (MSA, PSP, CBD) | Poor or waning levodopa response; atypical features (early falls in PSP, autonomic failure in MSA, asymmetric apraxia in CBD); faster progression; do NOT develop typical wearing-off pattern | Clinical diagnostic criteria; MRI (hot cross bun in MSA, hummingbird in PSP); DaTscan (does not distinguish PD from atypical) |
| Drug-induced parkinsonism | Temporal relationship to dopamine-blocking medications (antipsychotics, antiemetics); bilateral symmetric onset; no levodopa response or motor fluctuations | Medication reconciliation; DaTscan (normal in drug-induced); symptoms resolve with drug withdrawal (weeks-months) |
| Parkinson disease psychosis | Hallucinations, delusions, agitation — may be confused with "off" state psychiatric symptoms; medication-related vs disease-related | Temporal relationship to dopamine agonist dose changes; visual hallucinations (VH); clear sensorium (PD psychosis) vs confusion (delirium) |
| Depression in PD | Apathy, psychomotor retardation, and withdrawal may mimic off-state akinesia; should be evaluated as comorbidity, not just motor fluctuation | Depression screening (GDS, PHQ-9); symptoms present regardless of on/off state; trial of antidepressant |
| Orthostatic hypotension | Weakness, light-headedness, near-syncope when standing may be confused with off-state motor decline; PD and medications both cause OH | Orthostatic vital signs; symptoms correlate with BP drop, not motor state; treatment: fludrocortisone, midodrine, droxidopa |
| Gastroparesis (PD-related) | Delayed gastric emptying causes erratic levodopa absorption → dose failures and unpredictable on/off; common in PD | Gastric emptying study; trial of domperidone or liquid levodopa preparations |
| Freezing of gait | Sudden transient inability to initiate or continue walking; may be on-state freezing (medication-resistant) or off-state freezing; distinct from motor fluctuation per se | Motor diary documenting freezing timing relative to medication doses; observe gait |

## NOTES

- Motor fluctuations develop in ~50% of PD patients after 5 years and ~80-90% after 10 years of levodopa therapy
- Wearing off is the earliest and most common fluctuation — always ask "Does your medication wear off before the next dose?"
- The fundamental problem is loss of dopaminergic neurons that normally buffer levodopa into tonic dopamine release; as neurons are lost, brain dopamine levels fluctuate in parallel with plasma levodopa levels
- Priority in hospitalized PD patients: GIVE LEVODOPA ON TIME — medication timing errors are the most common and most dangerous hospital management failure in PD; medications should be flagged as time-critical
- NEVER give dopamine blockers (metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, promethazine, haloperidol, droperidol) to PD patients — these can trigger severe off crises or NMS-like syndrome; use ondansetron or domperidone for nausea
- If PD medications must be held (surgery, NPO): use NG tube for levodopa, SQ apomorphine, or rotigotine patch as bridge; keep NPO period as short as possible
- NMS-like syndrome from PD medication withdrawal: hyperthermia, severe rigidity, autonomic instability, altered consciousness; treat with IV dantrolene, aggressive cooling, resume dopaminergic medications immediately
- DBS candidacy: good levodopa responsiveness, troublesome fluctuations/dyskinesia despite optimal meds, adequate cognition, realistic expectations, disease duration >=4 years; STN vs GPi — discuss with DBS team
- Impulse control disorders (ICD) affect 15-40% of patients on dopamine agonists — screen at every visit; reduce or stop agonist if ICD develops
- Exercise is the most evidence-based non-pharmacologic intervention for PD motor function and should be recommended to all patients
