# Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** February 8, 2026
**REVISED:** February 8, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension

**ICD-10:** I95.1 (Orthostatic hypotension), G90.09 (Other idiopathic peripheral autonomic neuropathy)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC), 80048 (BMP), 84443 (TSH), 82607 (Vitamin B12), 82382 (Catecholamines, fractionated), 82384 (Catecholamines, 24-hour urine), 95924 (Tilt table test / autonomic testing), 95923 (QSART / sudomotor testing), 95922 (Autonomic function test — adrenergic), 95921 (Autonomic function test — cardiovagal), 93000 (12-lead ECG), 93306 (Echocardiogram), 70553 (MRI brain with and without contrast), 88305 (Skin biopsy pathology), 86235 (ANA), 83516 (Ganglionic AChR Ab), 83036 (HbA1c), 82533 (Cortisol), 78451 (Cardiac MIBG scintigraphy), 95907-95913 (Nerve conduction studies)

**SYNONYMS:** nOH, neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, postural hypotension, autonomic failure, orthostatic syncope, autonomic neuropathy with OH, sympathetic vasoconstrictor failure, neurogenic OH, autonomic orthostatic hypotension, orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic failure, adrenergic failure, autonomic insufficiency with orthostatic hypotension

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) in adults. Includes differentiation from non-neurogenic OH, etiologic workup (alpha-synucleinopathies, diabetic autonomic neuropathy, amyloid neuropathy, autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, pure autonomic failure), autonomic testing, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic management, supine hypertension management, and falls prevention. Covers ED, hospital, and outpatient settings. Excludes non-neurogenic causes of OH (dehydration, hemorrhage, medication-induced) unless as differential.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Orthostatic hypotension (OH):** Sustained reduction in SBP ≥20 mmHg or DBP ≥10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing or head-up tilt ≥60 degrees
- **Neurogenic OH (nOH):** OH caused by failure of the autonomic nervous system to adequately increase sympathetic output on standing; characterized by attenuated heart rate response (HR increase <15 bpm despite significant BP drop)
- **Non-neurogenic OH:** OH due to volume depletion, medications, cardiac pump failure, or other non-autonomic causes; typically with preserved or exaggerated heart rate response
- **Supine hypertension:** SBP ≥140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥90 mmHg in the supine position; present in up to 50% of nOH patients and complicates management
- **Alpha-synucleinopathy:** Group of neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, Lewy body dementia, pure autonomic failure) characterized by alpha-synuclein aggregation and frequent autonomic dysfunction
- **Pure autonomic failure (PAF):** Isolated autonomic failure without other neurological deficits; may phenoconvert to MSA, PD, or DLB
- **Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG):** Antibody-mediated autonomic failure due to ganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibodies; potentially treatable

## NOTES

- nOH is distinguished from non-neurogenic OH primarily by the attenuated heart rate response (HR rise <15 bpm) despite significant BP drop; this reflects the inability of the autonomic nervous system to compensate
- "Coat hanger" distribution pain (posterior neck and shoulders) is a characteristic symptom of nOH due to ischemia of postural neck muscles
- Supine hypertension is present in approximately 50% of nOH patients and creates a therapeutic dilemma: treating OH may worsen supine HTN and vice versa
- Head-of-bed elevation is a critical intervention that addresses both supine HTN and morning OH by reducing nocturnal natriuresis
- Droxidopa (Northera) is the only FDA-approved medication specifically for symptomatic nOH in autonomic failure; its long-term efficacy beyond 2 weeks is debated
- Patients with pure autonomic failure should be monitored for phenoconversion to MSA, PD, or DLB (occurs in approximately 34% over a median of 8 years)
- Cardiac MIBG scintigraphy differentiates postganglionic lesions (PD, PAF, DLB — decreased uptake) from preganglionic lesions (MSA — preserved uptake)
- Post-prandial hypotension is common in nOH and may be the most debilitating symptom; manage with small meals, reduced carbohydrates, acarbose, or octreotide
- Anti-ganglionic AChR antibodies should be tested in all subacute-onset autonomic failure, as autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy is a treatable cause
- Falls are the primary cause of morbidity in nOH; fall prevention must be addressed at every visit

## CHANGE LOG

**v1.1 (February 8, 2026)**
- Added ICU column to Section 4B (Patient Instructions) and 4C (Lifestyle) for structural consistency across all venue-tagged tables
- Expanded ED coverage in Section 4B: counter-pressure maneuvers, dietary guidance, environmental avoidance, fluid/salt intake, and water bolus now tagged ROUTINE for ED discharge teaching
- Added EXT coverage in ED and ICU for Section 3C first-line pharmacotherapy (midodrine, droxidopa, fludrocortisone) for patients already on these medications presenting acutely
- Added ICU coverage (ROUTINE) for Section 3E supine HTN management (nitroglycerin patch, losartan) and EXT for hydralazine; ICU patients with nOH commonly require supine HTN treatment
- Added HOSP EXT coverage for select Section 3D second-line agents (atomoxetine, EPO, octreotide, DDAVP) for refractory inpatient nOH
- Added HOSP ROUTINE coverage for Section 6 symptom burden monitoring (OHQ scale)
- Added ICU STAT coverage for bolus water drinking in Section 3A (patients able to take PO); added NPO status as contraindication
- Added ICU ROUTINE coverage for head-of-bed elevation in Section 3B and Section 4C
- Added ICU ROUTINE coverage for counter-pressure maneuvers in Section 3B
- Added URGENT ED coverage for cardiology referral in Section 4A (exclude cardiac etiology in acute presentations)
- Added ICU coverage for medication avoidance and constipation management in Section 4C
- Strengthened directive language in Section 3D atomoxetine row (removed "may benefit")
- Added 13th evidence reference (Gibbons et al. 2017 nOH screening/treatment algorithm)
- Updated version to 1.1

**v1.0 (February 8, 2026)**
- Initial template creation
- Comprehensive laboratory and autonomic testing workup
- Treatment organized by acuity: acute, non-pharmacologic, first-line, second-line/refractory, supine HTN management
- 15 individual medication rows with structured dosing
- Etiologic differential including alpha-synucleinopathies, amyloidosis, and AAG
- Supine hypertension management section with 4 short-acting agents
- 12 evidence references with PubMed links
