## 4. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS

### 4A. Referrals & Consults

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Comprehensive epilepsy center referral for presurgical evaluation if seizures persist despite two or more appropriately chosen ASMs (ILAE definition of DRE met) | - | URGENT | ROUTINE | - |
| Epileptologist consultation for ASM optimization, rational polytherapy, and candidacy assessment for surgery/neuromodulation | URGENT | URGENT | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| Neuropsychological testing for baseline cognitive assessment and presurgical lateralization of memory and language | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Psychiatry referral for depression, anxiety, or psychiatric comorbidity management (affects 30-50% of DRE patients) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Neurosurgery consultation when presurgical workup supports surgical candidacy (concordant localization data) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Registered dietitian for ketogenic diet or modified Atkins diet initiation and monitoring if pharmacotherapy insufficient | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Social work referral for disability assistance, vocational rehabilitation, and community resources for patients with functional limitations from DRE | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

| Physical therapy for fall prevention, injury management, and exercise program given recurrent seizure-related falls | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Palliative care or supportive care team for patients with severe refractory epilepsy significantly impacting quality of life | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Take all antiseizure medications exactly as prescribed; even one missed dose can trigger breakthrough seizures in DRE — use pill organizers and alarms | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Ensure rescue medication (nasal midazolam or rectal diazepam) is available at all times; train household members and caregivers on administration technique | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Return to ED immediately if seizure lasts >5 minutes, multiple seizures without recovery between them, seizure in water, significant head injury during seizure, or first seizure during pregnancy | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE |
| Do not drive until seizure-free for state-mandated period (varies by state, typically 3-12 months); discuss driving restrictions with neurologist at each visit | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Avoid swimming alone or unsupervised bathing; use showers instead of baths; avoid heights and open water without supervision due to drowning risk (leading cause of seizure-related death) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Keep a seizure diary (paper or app such as Seizure Tracker, EpiFinder) documenting date, time, duration, type, triggers, and medications taken — bring to all neurology visits | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace identifying epilepsy diagnosis and current medications for emergency responders | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Inform prescribing physicians about all ASMs before starting any new medication; many common drugs (antibiotics, psychiatric medications) interact with ASMs and can lower seizure threshold or affect ASM levels | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Prioritize consistent sleep schedule with 7-9 hours nightly; sleep deprivation is the most potent modifiable seizure trigger — avoid shift work if possible | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Avoid alcohol use; alcohol withdrawal lowers seizure threshold and alcohol interacts with ASMs; if unable to abstain, limit to ≤1 drink with food and never binge drink | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Implement stress reduction techniques (mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy) as chronic stress increases seizure frequency through cortisol-mediated excitotoxicity | - | - | ROUTINE |
| SUDEP risk reduction: optimize seizure control, ensure nocturnal supervision if possible, avoid prone sleeping position, consider seizure detection devices (watches, bed monitors) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Use reliable contraception for women of childbearing potential; enzyme-inducing ASMs (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) reduce efficacy of hormonal contraceptives — use IUD or barrier methods | - | - | ROUTINE |
| Home safety modifications: remove sharp furniture edges, install stove guards, use microwave instead of stovetop, shower instead of bath, avoid locked bathroom doors | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Consider protective headgear (SeizureGuard, Ribcap) for patients with frequent tonic or drop seizures to prevent head injury | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Pseudo-resistance (non-adherence) | Subtherapeutic ASM levels; missed doses; inconsistent refills; social/financial barriers | ASM trough levels; pharmacy refill records; pill counts; direct questioning |
| Pseudo-resistance (incorrect ASM for syndrome) | Wrong ASM for epilepsy syndrome (e.g., sodium channel blocker worsening absence or myoclonic epilepsy); diagnostic re-evaluation needed | Detailed seizure semiology; EEG classification (focal vs generalized); syndrome-appropriate ASM selection |
| Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) | Waxing/waning movements; eyes closed; pelvic thrusting; prolonged duration; out-of-phase limb movements; lack of postictal confusion | Video-EEG monitoring (gold standard); postictal prolactin (normal in PNES); PNES may coexist with epilepsy in 10-20% |
| Autoimmune epilepsy | New seizure onset or acceleration in previously controlled patient; cognitive decline; psychiatric symptoms; faciobrachial dystonic seizures (LGI1) | Autoimmune encephalitis antibody panel (serum + CSF); MRI (medial temporal T2/FLAIR signal); CSF pleocytosis |
| Progressive structural lesion | Gradual increase in seizure frequency; new neurologic deficits; papilledema | MRI with contrast; compare to prior imaging; consider tumor, vascular malformation, or progressive cortical dysplasia |
| Mitochondrial epilepsy (MELAS, MERRF) | Myoclonus; hearing loss; exercise intolerance; stroke-like episodes; elevated lactate; maternal inheritance | Serum/CSF lactate; genetic testing (m.3243A>G, m.8344A>G); muscle biopsy (ragged red fibers) |
| Drug interactions reducing ASM efficacy | New medication started (enzyme inducer/inhibitor); herbal supplements; grapefruit juice | Detailed medication reconciliation; ASM levels before and after new drug; pharmacokinetic interaction review |
| Catamenial epilepsy | Seizure clustering around menstruation (perimenstrual C1, periovulatory C2, luteal C3 patterns); may respond to hormonal therapy | Seizure diary with menstrual cycle mapping (3+ months); progesterone challenge; neurosteroid levels |
| Neurodegenerative disease with seizures | Progressive cognitive decline; parkinsonian features; seizures as late manifestation (Alzheimer's, frontotemporal dementia) | Neuropsychological testing; MRI volumetrics; FDG-PET; biomarkers (amyloid, tau) |
| FIRES (Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome) | Preceding febrile illness → explosive onset of refractory status epilepticus; typically in children/young adults; devastatingly refractory | EEG (super-refractory SE); MRI (initially normal, later hippocampal/cortical changes); extensive infectious/autoimmune workup negative |

### Red Flags Requiring Urgent Investigation

| Red Flag | Concern | Immediate Action |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Sudden increase in seizure frequency with no medication change | New structural lesion; autoimmune process; metabolic derangement | Urgent MRI; expanded labs; consider autoimmune workup |
| New focal neurologic deficit | Progressive structural lesion; stroke; post-ictal Todd paralysis (resolves) | Urgent neuroimaging; if Todd paralysis, should resolve within 24-48h |
| Cognitive decline beyond expected ASM effects | Autoimmune encephalitis; NCSE; neurodegenerative disease; ASM toxicity | Autoimmune panel; continuous EEG; neuropsychological testing; ASM levels |
| Seizures immediately after medication change | ASM interaction; paradoxical seizure aggravation; withdrawal effect | ASM levels; review interaction profile; consider reverting change |
| Psychiatric symptoms (psychosis, aggression) with seizure change | Forced normalization; ASM psychiatric effects (perampanel, levetiracetam); autoimmune process | Psychiatric evaluation; EEG (forced normalization shows EEG improvement with psychiatric worsening); ASM review |
| Weight loss, night sweats, new neurologic symptoms | Paraneoplastic syndrome; occult malignancy | Paraneoplastic antibody panel; CT chest/abdomen/pelvis; whole-body PET |

## APPENDIX B: DRE Evaluation Algorithm

1. **Confirm DRE diagnosis** → Failed ≥2 appropriately chosen ASMs at adequate doses with adequate adherence
2. **Rule out pseudo-resistance** → Check ASM levels, assess adherence, review seizure classification, consider PNES (video-EEG)
3. **Optimize current therapy** → Maximize current ASM doses; rational polytherapy; consider newer agents (cenobamate)
4. **Refer to comprehensive epilepsy center** → All DRE patients should be evaluated for surgical candidacy
5. **Presurgical evaluation** → Video-EEG, epilepsy protocol MRI, neuropsych, fMRI, PET; multidisciplinary conference
6. **Surgical candidate?**
   - YES → Resective surgery (ATL, focal resection, LITT) or RNS if focal
   - NO → VNS, DBS (focal/multifocal), dietary therapy, clinical trials
7. **Long-term management** → ASM optimization, comorbidity treatment, SUDEP risk reduction, quality of life

## APPENDIX C: Rational Polytherapy Guide

| Mechanism Class | Example ASMs | Preferred Combinations |
|----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Sodium channel blockers | Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide, phenytoin, eslicarbazepine, cenobamate | Combine with non-sodium channel mechanism |
| SV2A ligands | Levetiracetam, brivaracetam | Combine with sodium channel blocker or GABA modulator |

- Cenobamate + non-sodium channel ASM (avoid stacking sodium blockers)
- Clobazam + any non-benzodiazepine ASM (broad augmentation)
- Perampanel + sodium channel blocker (different mechanisms)
