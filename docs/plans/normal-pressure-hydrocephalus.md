**SYNONYMS:** NPH, idiopathic NPH (iNPH), Hakim-Adams syndrome, communicating hydrocephalus, chronic hydrocephalus, occult hydrocephalus, adult-onset hydrocephalus, secondary NPH, low-pressure hydrocephalus
**SCOPE:** Comprehensive evaluation of suspected NPH, diagnostic workup including high-volume lumbar puncture (tap test), prediction of shunt responsiveness, neurosurgical referral, and post-shunt monitoring. Covers idiopathic NPH (most common) and secondary NPH. Does not cover acute obstructive hydrocephalus or pediatric hydrocephalus.

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** January 27, 2026
**REVISED:** January 30, 2026

**STATUS:** Approved

---

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

**CLINICAL PEARL:** The classic triad of NPH is **"wet, wacky, wobbly"** - urinary incontinence, cognitive impairment, and gait disturbance. Gait is typically the first and most prominent symptom, and responds best to shunt surgery. The presence of all three symptoms is not required for diagnosis.

**Tap Test Protocol:**
1. Record baseline gait assessment (timed 10-meter walk, steps to walk 10 meters, Tinetti gait score)
2. Record baseline cognitive testing (MoCA or MMSE)
3. Remove 30-50 mL CSF
4. Repeat gait assessment at 30 min, 4 hours, 24 hours, and 72 hours post-LP
5. Repeat cognitive testing at 24-72 hours
6. **Positive tap test:** Improvement in gait (>20% faster walk time or >10% fewer steps) predicts shunt response

**Special Handling:** Standard CSF handling; freeze sample if sending for biomarkers
**Contraindications:** Coagulopathy (INR >1.5, platelets <50k); posterior fossa mass; skin infection at site; anticoagulation (hold appropriately)

### EXTENDED LUMBAR DRAIN TRIAL

**Indication:** Diagnostic uncertainty after single tap test; equivocal tap test results; more sensitive predictor of shunt response
**Setting:** Inpatient (requires admission for continuous drainage and monitoring)

## APPENDIX A: NPH IMAGING CRITERIA

### Evans Index Calculation
- **Evans index** = Maximum width of frontal horns / Maximum internal diameter of skull
- **Positive:** >0.3 (30%)

### Callosal Angle
- Measured on coronal MRI at level of posterior commissure
- **NPH:** <90 degrees (acute angle from dilated ventricles)
- **Atrophy:** >90 degrees (wider angle)

### DESH Pattern (Disproportionately Enlarged Subarachnoid-Space Hydrocephalus)
- Ventriculomegaly (Evans index >0.3)
- Tight high-convexity sulci (effaced sulci at vertex)
- Widened Sylvian fissures
- Focally dilated sulci

### Additional Imaging Features
- **Periventricular edema:** Transependymal CSF flow seen as T2/FLAIR hyperintensity around ventricles
- **Rounding of frontal horn angles:** Suggests pressure effect
- **Corpus callosum thinning:** From stretching

| Gait disturbance as predominant symptom | Strong predictor |
| Short duration of symptoms (<6 months) | Moderate predictor |
| Known etiology (secondary NPH: SAH, meningitis, trauma) | Strong predictor |
| Positive tap test (>20% improvement in gait) | Moderate predictor |
| Positive extended lumbar drain trial (>30% improvement) | Strong predictor |
| Hyperdynamic aqueductal CSF flow on MRI | Weak predictor |
| Presence of B-waves on ICP monitoring | Moderate predictor |

### Negative Predictors (Poorer Shunt Outcome)
| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Dementia predominant (gait normal) | Strong negative predictor |
| Long symptom duration (>2 years) | Moderate negative predictor |
| Severe cognitive impairment at baseline | Moderate negative predictor |
| Significant cortical atrophy | Moderate negative predictor |
| Negative tap test | Weak negative predictor |
| Comorbid Alzheimer's disease pathology | Strong negative predictor |

## APPENDIX C: SHUNT COMPLICATION OVERVIEW

| Complication | Incidence | Presentation | Management |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Overdrainage (subdural hematoma) | 2-17% | Headache worse when upright; new neurological deficits | Increase valve pressure; bed rest; surgical evacuation if large/symptomatic |
| Overdrainage (slit ventricle syndrome) | 5-10% | Positional headaches; small ventricles on imaging | Increase valve pressure; anti-siphon device |
| Underdrainage | 10-15% | Persistent or worsening NPH symptoms | Decrease valve pressure; evaluate for obstruction |
| Shunt infection | 5-10% | Fever; wound erythema; mental status change | IV antibiotics; shunt externalization/removal |
| Shunt obstruction | 5-15% | Symptom recurrence; inability to pump reservoir | Shunt revision surgery |
| Seizures | 3-5% | New-onset seizures post-operatively | Antiepileptic medication |
| Abdominal complications (VP) | 5-10% | Abdominal pain; pseudocyst; bowel perforation | Imaging evaluation; possible revision |
