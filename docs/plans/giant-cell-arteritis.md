# Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)

**VERSION:** 1.2
**CREATED:** January 30, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)

**ICD-10:** M31.6 (Other giant cell arteritis), M31.5 (Giant cell arteritis with polymyalgia rheumatica)

**SYNONYMS:** Giant cell arteritis, GCA, temporal arteritis, cranial arteritis, Horton disease, granulomatous arteritis, large-vessel vasculitis, polymyalgia rheumatica-associated vasculitis

**SCOPE:** Urgent diagnostic workup, empiric glucocorticoid treatment, and long-term management of giant cell arteritis. Covers cranial GCA (visual, neurologic), large-vessel GCA, overlap with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), vision-threatening presentations, steroid-sparing therapy, and disease monitoring. For isolated PMR without GCA features, GCA workup should still be considered. For other vasculitides (CNS vasculitis, PAN), use separate templates.

## 3. TREATMENT

### 3A. Acute/Emergent (Vision-Threatening GCA)

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Methylprednisolone IV pulse (vision-threatening) | IV | Visual symptoms: acute vision loss, amaurosis fugax, diplopia, AION, CRAO, cranial nerve palsy | 1000 mg :: IV :: daily x 3 days :: 1000 mg IV daily for 3 days (some protocols use 500 mg-1000 mg); infuse over 1-2 hours; then transition to oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day | Active untreated infection; uncontrolled diabetes; psychosis from steroids | Glucose q6h (target <180); BP; mood; electrolytes; GI prophylaxis | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Aspirin (low-dose) | PO | Antiplatelet therapy to reduce ischemic complications (visual loss, stroke) in GCA | 81 mg daily :: PO :: daily :: 81 mg PO daily | Active GI bleeding; aspirin allergy; concurrent anticoagulation (relative) | GI symptoms; bleeding signs | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Omeprazole (GI prophylaxis) | PO/IV | GI protection during high-dose steroids + aspirin | 40 mg daily :: PO :: daily :: 40 mg PO/IV daily while on steroids | PPI allergy | None routine | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |

*Note: VISUAL SYMPTOMS ARE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY. Start IV methylprednisolone IMMEDIATELY -- do NOT wait for biopsy, lab results, or imaging. Vision loss in GCA is often irreversible if untreated. The goal is to prevent vision loss in the fellow eye (bilateral involvement occurs in ~25-50% within days without treatment). If the patient can take oral medications and has no vision-threatening symptoms, oral prednisone can be started directly.*

### 3B. Standard Oral Glucocorticoid Treatment (Non-Vision-Threatening)

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Prednisone (initial high-dose) | PO | GCA without visual symptoms; after IV pulse for vision-threatening GCA | 1 mg/kg :: PO :: daily :: 1 mg/kg/day PO (max 60 mg); take in morning with food; maintain initial dose 2-4 weeks until symptoms resolve and ESR/CRP normalize | Active untreated infection; poorly controlled diabetes | Glucose; BP; weight; mood; bone density; cataracts; adrenal function | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Prednisone (taper phase 1: 40 mg → 20 mg) | PO | After 2-4 weeks at initial dose with symptom resolution | 40 mg :: PO :: daily :: Reduce by 5-10 mg every 2 weeks from 40 mg to 20 mg; monitor symptoms and ESR/CRP at each step | Same as above | ESR/CRP at each taper step; symptom recurrence | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Prednisone (taper phase 2: 20 mg → 10 mg) | PO | Continued improvement; normal inflammatory markers | 20 mg :: PO :: daily :: Reduce by 2.5 mg every 2-4 weeks from 20 mg to 10 mg; slower taper reduces relapse risk | Same as above | ESR/CRP; symptoms; adrenal function assessment | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Prednisone (taper phase 3: 10 mg → off) | PO | Near-remission; on steroid-sparing agent if available | 10 mg :: PO :: daily :: Reduce by 1 mg every month from 10 mg to off; total steroid duration typically 12-24 months; some patients require low-dose indefinitely | Adrenal insufficiency risk on discontinuation | Morning cortisol if dose <7.5 mg; ACTH stimulation test before complete discontinuation; ESR/CRP | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Calcium + Vitamin D (bone protection) | PO | All patients on chronic steroids | 1000 mg Ca + 2000 IU Vit D :: PO :: daily :: Calcium 1000-1200 mg/day + Vitamin D 2000-4000 IU/day (target 25-OH >30 ng/mL) | Hypercalcemia; kidney stones | 25-OH Vitamin D level; calcium; DEXA at baseline and annually | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Alendronate (bisphosphonate for osteoporosis prevention) | PO | Steroids anticipated >3 months; T-score ≤-1.0 | 70 mg weekly :: PO :: weekly :: 70 mg PO weekly; take on empty stomach with 8 oz water; remain upright 30 min | Esophageal disorders; CrCl <35; hypocalcemia | DEXA q1-2 years; dental health (osteonecrosis of jaw); esophageal symptoms | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

*Note: Typical steroid taper duration is 12-24 months. Relapse rate on taper is ~50%. Most relapses occur when prednisone dose is below 10-15 mg or within 1 year of discontinuation. Monitor ESR/CRP at each taper step -- rising markers may herald relapse. Cumulative steroid toxicity is the major long-term concern (osteoporosis, diabetes, cataracts, infections, weight gain, skin fragility).*

### 3C. Steroid-Sparing Therapy

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| **Tocilizumab (Actemra)** | SC | FDA-approved steroid-sparing agent for GCA (GiACTA trial); reduces relapse rate and steroid exposure | 162 mg :: SC :: weekly :: 162 mg SC weekly (preferred) or every 2 weeks; self-injectable; can also use 8 mg/kg IV q4wk | Active infection; hepatic impairment (ALT >5x ULN); diverticulitis; concurrent live vaccines; ANC <2000; platelets <100K | CBC q4-8 weeks; LFTs q4-8 weeks; lipid panel q3 months; infection surveillance; GI perforation risk; neutropenia; NOTE: tocilizumab suppresses ESR/CRP -- cannot use these for disease monitoring (use IL-6 or clinical assessment instead) | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Methotrexate | PO | Steroid-sparing alternative (weaker evidence than tocilizumab); relapse prevention | 7.5 mg :: PO :: weekly :: Start 7.5-10 mg PO weekly; titrate to 15-25 mg/week; take with folic acid 1 mg daily (except MTX day) | Pregnancy; hepatic disease; CrCl <30; active infection; interstitial lung disease | CBC q2-4 weeks initially, then q1-3 months; LFTs q1-3 months; CrCl; pulmonary symptoms (pneumonitis); folate supplementation | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Folic acid (with methotrexate) | PO | Reduce methotrexate side effects (stomatitis, cytopenias) | 1 mg daily :: PO :: daily :: 1 mg PO daily (skip day of MTX) | None significant | None routine | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Leflunomide | PO | Alternative steroid-sparing if MTX intolerant (limited evidence) | 10-20 mg daily :: PO :: daily :: 10-20 mg PO daily | Pregnancy (Category X); hepatic disease | CBC; LFTs monthly x 6 months, then q1-3 months; BP; diarrhea | - | - | EXT | - |

*Note: Tocilizumab (GiACTA trial, 2017) is the only FDA-approved steroid-sparing agent for GCA. It significantly reduces relapse rate and allows faster steroid taper. IMPORTANT: Tocilizumab suppresses ESR and CRP, making these markers unreliable for disease monitoring -- use clinical assessment and IL-6 levels instead. Methotrexate has mixed trial data (3 RCTs with conflicting results) but is commonly used as a cheaper alternative. Consider steroid-sparing therapy for all GCA patients to reduce cumulative steroid toxicity.*

## CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT NOTES

### ACR 1990 Classification Criteria (≥3 of 5 = GCA)

1. Age at disease onset ≥50 years
2. New headache (new onset or new type)
3. Temporal artery abnormality (tenderness or reduced pulse)
4. Elevated ESR ≥50 mm/hr (Westergren)
5. Abnormal artery biopsy (granulomatous inflammation with giant cells)

*Sensitivity 93.5%, specificity 91.2%*

### GCA Clinical Presentations

| Presentation | Frequency | Key Features |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Cranial GCA (classic) | ~70% | Headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, temporal artery tenderness |
| Ophthalmic GCA | ~15-20% | AION (most common cause of GCA vision loss); CRAO; diplopia; amaurosis fugax |
| Large-vessel GCA | ~50% (often subclinical) | Upper extremity claudication; aortitis; subclavian/axillary stenosis |
| PMR overlap | ~40-60% | Proximal myalgias (shoulders, hips); morning stiffness >1 hour; elevated ESR |
| Constitutional only | ~15% | Fever of unknown origin; weight loss; malaise; elevated ESR |

### Vision Loss Prevention Pathway

```
Suspected GCA with ANY visual symptom
  ↓
STAT ophthalmology exam + STAT ESR/CRP
  ↓
START IV methylprednisolone 1000 mg IMMEDIATELY (do NOT wait for labs or biopsy)
  ↓
Temporal artery ultrasound within 24h
  ↓
Temporal artery biopsy within 1-2 weeks (remains positive on steroids)
  ↓
After 3 days IV steroids → oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day
  ↓
Monitor visual acuity daily until stable
```

### Steroid Taper Schedule (Approximate)

| Dose Range | Reduction | Interval | Total at This Phase |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| 60 mg → 40 mg | -5 to -10 mg | Every 2 weeks | ~4-8 weeks |
| 40 mg → 20 mg | -5 mg | Every 2 weeks | ~8 weeks |
| 20 mg → 10 mg | -2.5 mg | Every 2-4 weeks | ~8-16 weeks |
| 10 mg → 0 mg | -1 mg | Every 4 weeks | ~10 months |
| **Total taper** | | | **~12-24 months** |

*Adjust based on symptoms and ESR/CRP. Relapse at any point: return to last effective dose.*
