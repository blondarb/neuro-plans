# Functional Cognitive Disorder (FCD)

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** February 11, 2026
**REVISED:** February 11, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Functional Cognitive Disorder (FCD)

**ICD-10:** F44.89 (Other dissociative and conversion disorders), R41.3 (Other amnesia), R41.89 (Other symptoms and signs involving cognitive functions and awareness)

**SYNONYMS:** Functional cognitive disorder, FCD, subjective cognitive decline with normal testing, functional memory disorder, psychogenic cognitive impairment, dissociative cognitive disorder, cognitive symptoms in functional neurological disorder, subjective cognitive complaints without objective deficit

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of functional cognitive disorder -- subjective cognitive complaints (memory, attention, word-finding, concentration) with normal or near-normal objective neuropsychological testing. Differentiation from neurodegenerative dementias (Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and other organic causes of cognitive decline. Cognitive behavioral approaches, psychoeducation, and management of perpetuating comorbidities (depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, chronic pain). Complements existing FND and Dementia Evaluation plans. For broader FND management, see "Functional Neurological Disorder" template. For neurodegenerative dementia workup, see "Dementia Evaluation" template.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 1. LABORATORY WORKUP

### 1A. Essential/Core Labs

| Test | Rationale | Target Finding | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|------|-----------|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| CBC with differential (CPT 85025) | Baseline; rule out anemia, infection as contributor to cognitive symptoms | Normal | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| CMP (BMP + LFTs) (CPT 80053) | Metabolic encephalopathy screen; hepatic/renal dysfunction causing cognitive impairment | Normal | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| TSH (CPT 84443) | Hypothyroidism is a common, reversible cause of cognitive complaints | Normal (0.4-4.0 mIU/L) | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| Vitamin B12 (CPT 82607) | B12 deficiency causes reversible cognitive impairment and must be excluded | Normal (>300 pg/mL) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Folate (CPT 82746) | Folate deficiency associated with cognitive impairment | Normal | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Blood glucose (CPT 82947) | Hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia as contributor to cognitive symptoms | Normal | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Vitamin D 25-OH (CPT 82306) | Deficiency associated with cognitive complaints, fatigue, and mood disorders | Normal (>30 ng/mL) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| ESR (CPT 85652) | Inflammatory/autoimmune screen | Normal | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| CRP (CPT 86140) | Inflammatory screen | Normal | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT |

*Note: The purpose of labs in FCD is to exclude reversible medical causes of cognitive impairment, NOT to diagnose FCD. FCD is diagnosed clinically by the pattern of cognitive complaints, internal inconsistency on testing, and specific cognitive features (see Clinical Decision Support Notes). Avoid excessive testing -- over-investigation reinforces illness beliefs and delays appropriate treatment.*

### 1B. Extended Workup (Context-Dependent)

| Test | Rationale | Target Finding | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |

## 2. DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING & STUDIES

### 2A. Essential/First-line

| Study | Timing | Target Finding | Contraindications | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-------|--------|----------------|-------------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| MRI brain with and without contrast (CPT 70553) | Within 2-4 weeks; not urgent unless red flags | Normal (no atrophy, no white matter disease, no mass); provides reassurance and excludes structural pathology | Standard MRI contraindications | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| Neuropsychological testing (CPT 96132, 96133) | Outpatient; schedule within 1-3 months | Normal or near-normal performance with internal inconsistency; effort testing normal; pattern inconsistent with neurodegenerative profile (see Clinical Notes) | Active psychiatric crisis; severe pain | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

*Note: Neuropsychological testing is the CORNERSTONE of differentiating FCD from neurodegenerative MCI/dementia. Key FCD patterns: (1) Complaints far exceed objective deficits; (2) Performance improves with structure and cues; (3) Effort testing is normal or variable; (4) Attention/processing speed may be mildly reduced (reflecting comorbid depression/anxiety/poor sleep) while memory encoding is preserved; (5) No progressive decline on serial testing. See Clinical Decision Support Notes for detailed differentiation.*

### 2B. Extended

| Study | Timing | Target Finding | Contraindications | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-------|--------|----------------|-------------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| MoCA or MMSE (bedside cognitive screen) (CPT 96116) | At presentation; serial assessments | Score typically normal (>26/30 MoCA) or mildly reduced due to inattention; stability over time supports FCD | None | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| FDG-PET brain (CPT 78608) | If clinical uncertainty between FCD and early neurodegeneration | Normal metabolism (no temporoparietal or frontal hypometabolism); confirms absence of neurodegenerative pattern | Uncontrolled diabetes; pregnancy | - | - | EXT | - |

| EEG (routine) (CPT 95816) | If seizure-related cognitive complaints or transient amnestic episodes | Normal | None significant | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT |

### 2C. Rare/Specialized

| Study | Timing | Target Finding | Contraindications | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-------|--------|----------------|-------------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Volumetric MRI (hippocampal volume) | If longitudinal concern for progression | Normal hippocampal volume (no atrophy) | Standard MRI contraindications | - | - | EXT | - |
| CSF AD biomarkers (via lumbar puncture) | If amyloid PET unavailable and high diagnostic uncertainty | Normal CSF amyloid/tau ratio (excludes AD) | Coagulopathy; raised ICP | - | EXT | EXT | - |
| Tau PET (Flortaucipir) | Research or refractory diagnostic uncertainty | Negative tau deposition | Pregnancy | - | - | EXT | - |

## 3. TREATMENT

### 3A. Acute/Emergent (Cognitive Crisis Presentations)

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Reassurance and de-escalation | - | Acute cognitive complaint presentation in ED; patient distress about memory loss | N/A :: - :: - :: Use calm, validating language; "I can see how distressing these symptoms are"; avoid dismissive statements; do not say "there's nothing wrong"; provide clear plan for outpatient workup | None | Patient anxiety level; understanding of plan | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Exclude delirium/acute organic cause | - | Acute confusion or cognitive change in ED/inpatient setting; must differentiate FCD exacerbation from delirium | N/A :: - :: - :: Complete metabolic workup; medication review; assess for infection, intoxication, metabolic derangement; CAM score for delirium; if negative for organic cause and consistent with known FCD pattern, reassure | None | Mental status; vital signs; CAM score | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Lorazepam (ONLY if severe panic/acute anxiety with cognitive symptoms) | IV/PO | Severe acute anxiety with functional cognitive decompensation; NOT for routine FCD | 0.5 mg :: PO :: PRN :: 0.5-1 mg PO or IV x1 PRN for severe anxiety only; do NOT use routinely; avoid repeated dosing; transition to non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic | Respiratory depression; acute alcohol intoxication; myasthenia gravis | Respiratory status; sedation level; do not continue beyond acute episode | URGENT | URGENT | - | URGENT |

*Note: FCD rarely presents as an acute emergency. Most ED presentations involve patients concerned about "sudden memory loss" or family concerned about cognitive decline. The key acute intervention is: (1) exclude delirium and organic causes, (2) provide reassurance, and (3) arrange appropriate outpatient evaluation. Avoid excessive acute testing that reinforces illness anxiety.*

### 3B. Diagnosis Communication and Psychoeducation (Core Treatment)

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Structured diagnosis delivery session | - | All FCD patients; the single most important therapeutic intervention | N/A :: - :: - :: Explain FCD as a real condition where the brain's "filing system" works correctly but the "search function" is disrupted; memory is encoded but retrieval is inefficient due to attention/anxiety interference; show patient their NORMAL test results as evidence that memory hardware is intact; contrast with dementia pattern; validate symptoms; express confidence in diagnosis and treatability | None | Patient understanding; acceptance; emotional response; therapeutic alliance | URGENT | URGENT | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| Cognitive psychoeducation | - | All FCD patients; understanding the mechanism of cognitive symptoms | N/A :: - :: - :: Teach the attention-memory model: anxiety and poor sleep hijack attentional resources needed for memory encoding and retrieval; demonstrate with divided attention tasks; explain that memory improves when attention improves; provide written materials and neurosymptoms.org/cognitive-symptoms | None | Patient engagement; comprehension | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Family/caregiver education session | - | Family members concerned about dementia; caregiver burden; family reinforcing illness behavior | N/A :: - :: - :: Educate family that FCD is NOT dementia and will NOT progress to dementia; teach family to avoid "testing" the patient's memory (harmful); encourage normal activities and independence; reduce accommodation of avoidance behaviors | None | Family understanding; reduction in accommodation behaviors | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

*Note: HOW the diagnosis is communicated determines treatment engagement and outcomes. Key principles: (1) Use the term "Functional Cognitive Disorder" -- not "there's nothing wrong" or "just anxiety"; (2) Explain the mechanism: attention + anxiety interfere with cognitive efficiency; (3) Show NORMAL test results as PROOF the brain is structurally healthy; (4) Clearly state this is NOT dementia and will NOT become dementia; (5) Express confidence and emphasize treatability; (6) Avoid implying symptoms are fabricated.*

### 3C. Psychological Treatment (Primary Treatment)

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|

*Note: There is NO medication that directly treats FCD. Pharmacotherapy targets COMORBIDITIES (depression, anxiety, insomnia, pain) that PERPETUATE cognitive complaints. CRITICAL: Do NOT prescribe cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) or memantine for FCD -- these are ineffective, cause unnecessary side effects, and reinforce the false belief that the patient has dementia. If a patient with FCD is already on a cholinesterase inhibitor, taper and discontinue with clear explanation.*

### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Your cognitive symptoms are REAL -- Functional Cognitive Disorder means your brain's "search engine" is working inefficiently, but your memory storage is intact (this is NOT dementia) | Y | Y | Y |
| Visit www.neurosymptoms.org/cognitive-symptoms for reliable, expert-written information about functional cognitive symptoms | Y | Y | Y |
| FCD does NOT progress to dementia -- your brain structure is healthy; cognitive efficiency improves with treatment of underlying anxiety, depression, and sleep problems | Y | Y | Y |
| Stop monitoring your memory for errors -- constantly checking whether you remembered something correctly WORSENS cognitive performance by diverting attention (like a computer running too many background programs) | - | Y | Y |
| Reduce reliance on excessive compensatory strategies (constant list-making, asking others to confirm memories, avoiding new information) -- these safety behaviors maintain the problem | - | Y | Y |
| Prioritize sleep -- poor sleep is one of the strongest drivers of cognitive inefficiency; aim for 7-9 hours of consistent, quality sleep | - | Y | Y |
| Engage with recommended psychological therapy (CBT, MCT) -- these are the evidence-based treatments for FCD and have demonstrated improvement in studies | - | Y | Y |
| Limit internet searches about dementia -- health anxiety and "Dr. Google" reinforce catastrophic beliefs and worsen cognitive symptoms | - | Y | Y |
| Return to activities you have been avoiding due to cognitive concerns -- gradual re-engagement improves cognitive confidence and function | - | Y | Y |
| Return to ED for NEW symptoms clearly different from your usual cognitive complaints, such as sudden severe headache, sudden confusion with fever, one-sided weakness, or seizures | Y | Y | Y |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Regular aerobic exercise (30 min, 5x/week) to improve mood, sleep quality, and cognitive function through increased cerebral blood flow and neuroplasticity | - | Y | Y |
| Sleep hygiene optimization: consistent bed/wake times, avoid screens 1 hour before bed, limit caffeine after noon, dark/cool bedroom -- poor sleep is the #1 modifiable perpetuating factor for FCD | - | Y | Y |
| Stress management through mindfulness, breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or yoga -- chronic stress impairs attentional resources needed for memory | - | Y | Y |
| Limit alcohol intake (alcohol directly impairs cognitive function and sleep architecture, worsening FCD symptoms) | - | Y | Y |
| Maintain social engagement and intellectually stimulating activities -- isolation and cognitive inactivity worsen subjective cognitive complaints | - | Y | Y |
| Pacing activities to avoid cognitive overload -- schedule demanding tasks during peak alertness (typically morning); take breaks to prevent attention fatigue | - | Y | Y |
| Balanced diet with emphasis on Mediterranean-style eating pattern for brain health (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, omega-3 fatty acids) | - | Y | Y |
| Reduce multitasking -- single-task focus improves cognitive performance; multitasking divides attention and increases subjective memory failures | - | Y | Y |

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Alzheimer disease (early/prodromal) | Progressive episodic memory loss with encoding failure; hippocampal atrophy; abnormal biomarkers; insidious onset over years; loss of recent memories with preservation of remote | Neuropsychological testing (encoding deficit with poor cuing); MRI (hippocampal atrophy); amyloid PET or CSF biomarkers (abnormal amyloid/tau); FDG-PET (temporoparietal hypometabolism) |
| Mild Cognitive Impairment (amnestic MCI) | Objective memory impairment (1-1.5 SD below norms) with preserved daily function; gradual progression; may convert to dementia | Neuropsychological testing (objective deficit on delayed recall); serial testing (progressive decline); biomarkers if available |
| Frontotemporal dementia (behavioral variant) | Personality change; disinhibition; apathy; executive dysfunction; relatively preserved memory; frontal atrophy | Neuropsychological testing (executive > memory deficit); MRI (frontal/temporal atrophy); FDG-PET (frontal hypometabolism) |
| Lewy body dementia | Visual hallucinations; fluctuating cognition; parkinsonism; REM sleep behavior disorder; visuospatial deficits | DaTscan (abnormal); polysomnography (RBD); neuropsychological testing (visuospatial + attention > memory); MRI (less atrophy than AD) |
| Depression with cognitive symptoms (pseudodementia) | Prominent mood symptoms preceding cognitive complaints; effort-related poor performance; improves with antidepressant treatment; "I don't know" responses | PHQ-9; neuropsychological testing (effort-dependent, inconsistent performance); treatment response to antidepressants |
| Anxiety disorder with cognitive complaints | Prominent anxiety; attentional deficits secondary to worry; catastrophizing about normal memory lapses; hypervigilance to cognitive errors | GAD-7; neuropsychological testing (attention/processing speed deficits with intact memory encoding); treatment response |
| Obstructive sleep apnea | Excessive daytime sleepiness; snoring; witnessed apneas; morning headaches; cognitive fog improves after CPAP treatment | Polysomnography (AHI); CPAP trial with cognitive reassessment |
| Medication-induced cognitive impairment | Temporal correlation with medication initiation; anticholinergic burden; benzodiazepines; opioids; anticonvulsants | Medication review (Beers criteria, anticholinergic burden score); trial medication reduction; cognitive reassessment |
| Chronic fatigue syndrome / fibromyalgia | Prominent fatigue and "brain fog"; widespread pain; sleep disruption; overlaps significantly with FCD | Clinical criteria for CFS/fibromyalgia; neuropsychological testing shows attention/processing speed deficits |
| Normal aging | Mild subjective cognitive slowing; tip-of-the-tongue phenomena; normal neuropsychological performance; not functionally impairing | Age-adjusted neuropsychological norms (performance within normal range); stable over time |
| Autoimmune encephalitis (anti-LGI1, anti-NMDAR) | Subacute onset; seizures; psychiatric symptoms; movement disorder; MRI/EEG abnormalities | Autoimmune encephalitis antibody panel (serum and CSF); MRI; EEG |
| Delirium | Acute onset; fluctuating attention; altered consciousness; identifiable medical cause | CAM score; metabolic workup; medication review; resolves with treatment of underlying cause |

*Note: FCD may COEXIST with organic cognitive conditions. Patients with early MCI or treated depression may develop superimposed FCD where subjective complaints far exceed objective deficits. The presence of mild organic cognitive changes does NOT exclude comorbid FCD.*

## CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT NOTES

### Diagnostic Features of Functional Cognitive Disorder

**Core Features (Ball et al. 2020 Criteria):**
1. **Internal inconsistency:** Cognitive performance varies markedly depending on context, attention, and emotional state (better performance with structure and cues, worse when anxious or self-monitoring)
2. **Complaint-performance mismatch:** Subjective cognitive complaints are disproportionately severe relative to objective test performance
3. **Symptom characteristics inconsistent with neurodegeneration:** Detailed, vivid recall of forgotten events; awareness of memory failures (true amnestics are unaware); "tip of the tongue" with eventual retrieval; better recognition than free recall
4. **Identifiable perpetuating factors:** Depression, anxiety, sleep disruption, chronic pain, attentional self-monitoring, health anxiety

**"Red Flags" Suggesting Organic Cognitive Decline (NOT FCD):**
- Progressive worsening over months-years with measurable decline on serial testing
- Loss of awareness of deficits (anosognosia) -- FCD patients are HYPER-aware
- Getting lost in familiar places
- Difficulty with learned motor tasks (apraxia)
- Language output errors the patient does not recognize
- Objective decline on neuropsychological testing in memory encoding (not just retrieval)
- Abnormal biomarkers (amyloid PET, CSF tau/amyloid ratio, hippocampal atrophy)

### Neuropsychological Testing: FCD vs Neurodegenerative MCI/Dementia

| Feature | Functional Cognitive Disorder | Neurodegenerative MCI/Dementia |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Complaints vs performance | Complaints >> objective deficits | Complaints match or underestimate deficits |
| Awareness of deficits | Heightened (hyperaware of every lapse) | Often reduced (anosognosia in moderate stages) |
| Memory encoding | INTACT (information gets in) | IMPAIRED (information does not encode) |
| Cued recall/recognition | Significantly improves with cues | Cuing provides minimal benefit (encoding failure) |
| Effort/validity testing | Normal or variable | Normal (unless severe) |
| Attention/processing speed | Often mildly impaired (anxiety/depression driven) | May be preserved early (AD) or impaired (vascular, LBD) |
| Pattern over time | Stable or improves with treatment | Progressive decline |
| Performance consistency | Variable -- may perform well on hard tasks, poorly on easy ones | Consistent pattern matching severity |

### Perpetuating Factors Model for FCD

| Factor | Mechanism | Intervention |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Depression** | Reduces motivation, concentration, processing speed; ruminative cognition consumes attentional resources | SSRI/SNRI; CBT for depression |
| **Anxiety** | Hypervigilance to cognitive errors diverts attention from encoding; performance anxiety impairs retrieval | CBT; anxiolytic; attention training |
| **Sleep disruption** | Poor sleep directly impairs memory consolidation and next-day attention | Sleep hygiene; trazodone; melatonin; treat OSA |
| **Attentional self-monitoring** | Constantly checking "did I remember?" disrupts automatic cognitive processes | CBT (reduce safety behaviors); metacognitive therapy |
| **Health anxiety (dementia phobia)** | Fear of dementia drives hypervigilance to normal cognitive lapses; internet searching reinforces catastrophic beliefs | Psychoeducation; CBT for health anxiety |
| **Avoidance** | Avoiding cognitively demanding activities leads to deconditioning and reduced cognitive confidence | Graded cognitive exposure; behavioral activation |
| **Chronic pain/fatigue** | Pain and fatigue consume attentional resources; medications (opioids, anticonvulsants) may impair cognition | Pain management optimization; medication review |
| **Iatrogenic reinforcement** | Repeated "dementia testing," unnecessary specialist referrals, and tentative diagnoses reinforce illness beliefs | Clear, confident FCD diagnosis; minimize unnecessary re-testing |

### What NOT to Do in FCD

| Harmful Approach | Why It's Harmful | Instead Do |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| "Your tests are normal, nothing is wrong" | Invalidating; patient knows something is wrong | "Your brain structure is healthy; this is FCD -- a real condition affecting cognitive efficiency" |
| Prescribe cholinesterase inhibitors | Reinforces dementia belief; unnecessary side effects; no efficacy | Explain FCD is not dementia; taper if already prescribed |
| Repeat neuropsychological testing frequently | Reinforces illness behavior; no clinical benefit if stable | Test once at baseline; repeat only at 12-18 months or if clinical change |
| Refer to "rule out dementia" | Anxiety-provoking label; increases health anxiety | Refer for "cognitive evaluation" with clear clinical question |
| Say "it might be early dementia" | Creates diagnostic uncertainty that perpetuates symptoms | Provide clear, confident FCD diagnosis when criteria are met |
| Order excessive labs/imaging on repeat visits | Over-investigation reinforces illness beliefs | Focused workup once; avoid repetition unless new clinical features |
