# Optic Neuritis

**DIAGNOSIS:** Optic Neuritis
**ICD-10:** H46.9 (Optic neuritis, unspecified); H46.00 (Optic papillitis, unspecified eye); H46.10 (Retrobulbar neuritis, unspecified eye); G36.0 (Neuromyelitis optica - if NMOSD confirmed); H46.8 (Other optic neuritis)
**SYNONYMS:** Optic neuropathy (inflammatory), retrobulbar neuritis, papillitis, demyelinating optic neuropathy, acute optic neuritis, ON, MS-associated optic neuritis, clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) - optic neuritis, optic perineuritis, MOGAD optic neuritis, NMOSD optic neuritis
**SCOPE:** Acute evaluation and management of optic neuritis in adults. Covers typical demyelinating optic neuritis, atypical features requiring expanded workup, MS risk stratification, ONTT-based treatment, and NMO/MOG antibody evaluation. For established MS with optic neuritis as a relapse, can also use "MS - Exacerbation" template.

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** January 27, 2026
**REVISED:** January 30, 2026

**STATUS:** Approved

---

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

**CLINICAL PEARL:** The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) established that IV methylprednisolone accelerates visual recovery but does not change final visual outcome. Oral prednisone alone at standard doses (1 mg/kg/day) was associated with increased recurrence rate and should NOT be used as monotherapy. Most patients (90%+) recover vision to 20/40 or better within 1 year.
