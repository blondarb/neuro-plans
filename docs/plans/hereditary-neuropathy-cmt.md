| Test | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale | Target Finding |
|------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|----------------|
| PMP22 duplication/deletion (CPT 81324) | - | - | ROUTINE | - | First-line test: PMP22 duplication = CMT1A (~60% of CMT1); PMP22 deletion = HNPP; order if demyelinating NCS pattern (median motor NCV <38 m/s) | Identifies CMT1A or HNPP |
| GJB1/Connexin 32 sequencing (CPT 81406) | - | - | ROUTINE | - | Second-line if PMP22 negative; CMTX1 is second most common CMT; order especially if intermediate NCV (25-40 m/s) or X-linked pattern | Identifies CMTX1 |

|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|----------------|
| MRI brain with contrast (CPT 70553) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | CMTX1: transient white matter lesions during metabolic stress; CMT4 subtypes with CNS involvement; exclude structural causes | Normal in most CMT; CMTX1 may show reversible white matter changes |
| MRI spine (cervical/lumbar) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Exclude compressive myelopathy/radiculopathy as contributing factor; hypertrophic nerves in Dejerine-Sottas | No cord compression; may show nerve root hypertrophy in demyelinating CMT |

### 2B. Advanced Imaging

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale | Target Finding |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|----------------|
| MR neurography (brachial plexus / lumbosacral plexus) | - | - | EXT | - | Assess nerve hypertrophy pattern; differentiate from CIDP or neoplastic infiltration; research use in CMT | Uniform nerve enlargement (CMT1); CIDP tends to be patchy/multifocal |
| Nerve ultrasound (high-resolution) | - | - | ROUTINE | - | Non-invasive assessment of nerve cross-sectional area; diffusely enlarged nerves in CMT1A; focal enlargement suggests acquired neuropathy or HNPP | Diffusely enlarged nerves (CMT1); normal caliber (CMT2) |

### 2C. Pulmonary Function Assessment

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale | Target Finding |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|----------------|
| Spirometry (FVC upright and supine) (CPT 94010) | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | STAT | Assess respiratory muscle weakness; FVC <80% predicted or >10% drop supine indicates diaphragm weakness; relevant in severe CMT, CMT2C, CMT4; ED/ICU if respiratory distress | FVC >80% predicted; <10% supine drop |
| Echocardiogram (CPT 93306) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | Screen for cardiomyopathy in LMNA-related CMT2; arrhythmias in selected subtypes; ICU if cardiac concerns | Normal LVEF; no structural abnormalities |
| ECG (CPT 93000) | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | STAT | Screen for conduction abnormalities; LMNA mutations associated with cardiac conduction disease; baseline before starting TCAs | Normal sinus rhythm; no conduction block |

### LUMBAR PUNCTURE

**Indication:** Differentiate CMT from CIDP when clinical/electrodiagnostic distinction is unclear; evaluate for elevated protein in Dejerine-Sottas disease
**Timing:** ROUTINE in most cases; not typically urgent
**Volume Required:** 10-15 mL (standard diagnostic)

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | Rationale | Target Finding |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|-----------|----------------|
| CSF protein | - | ROUTINE | EXT | CMT has normal or mildly elevated protein; CIDP typically >45 mg/dL; Dejerine-Sottas may have markedly elevated protein | Normal (<45 mg/dL) |
| Cell count (tubes 1 and 4) | - | ROUTINE | EXT | Rule out inflammatory process; normal in CMT | WBC <5; RBC 0 |
| CSF glucose | - | ROUTINE | EXT | Normal in CMT; low in infectious/inflammatory meningitis | Normal |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Neurotoxic medication avoidance is the single most important actionable step — document prominently in chart and allergy list | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Moderate aerobic exercise (walking, swimming, cycling) improves fitness and quality of life without worsening neuropathy | - | ✓ | ✓ |

## NOTES

- **Vincristine is ABSOLUTELY CONTRAINDICATED** in all CMT patients and carriers — can cause fatal neurotoxicity even at standard doses; document prominently in allergy/alert list
- CMT is the most common inherited neuropathy (~1:2,500 prevalence); CMT1A (PMP22 duplication) accounts for ~60% of all CMT
- Genetic testing strategy: start with PMP22 duplication/deletion (covers CMT1A and HNPP); if negative, test GJB1 (CMTX1), then MPZ (CMT1B); if all negative, proceed to multigene NGS panel
- HNPP (PMP22 deletion) presents with episodic painless pressure palsies — consider in patients with recurrent carpal tunnel, peroneal palsy, or ulnar neuropathy
- CMTX1 (GJB1): intermediate NCV in males; females may be asymptomatic or mildly affected; transient CNS symptoms (white matter lesions on MRI) can occur with metabolic stress or high altitude
- No disease-modifying therapy currently approved for any CMT subtype — management is supportive (orthotics, rehabilitation, pain management, neurotoxic medication avoidance, surgical correction of deformity)
- Anesthesia considerations: avoid succinylcholine in patients with significant muscle wasting (hyperkalemia risk); cautious use of neuromuscular blocking agents; document CMT in preoperative evaluation
- CMT1A progression is typically slow (1-2 points per year on CMTNS); most patients maintain ambulation; ~10% require wheelchair by age 50
- Distinguish CMT from treatable mimics: CIDP (responds to IVIg/steroids/PLEX), anti-MAG neuropathy (responds to rituximab), Refsum disease (dietary phytanic acid restriction)
