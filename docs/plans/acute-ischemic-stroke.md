|-------------|----------|
| **Discharge home** | Minor stroke or TIA; able to ambulate safely or with minimal assistance; swallow intact; stable on oral medications; adequate home support; follow-up arranged within 1-2 weeks; compliant with secondary prevention |
| **Admit to stroke unit/floor** | Most acute ischemic strokes; requires monitoring, workup, rehabilitation assessment; stable vital signs; no respiratory compromise |
| **Admit to ICU** | Received tPA or thrombectomy (24h monitoring); large vessel occlusion; declining neurological exam; respiratory compromise; malignant edema risk; BP requiring IV infusion; arrhythmia requiring intervention |
| **Inpatient rehabilitation** | Significant functional deficits; able to participate in 3 hours therapy/day; medically stable; expected to benefit |
| **Skilled nursing facility** | Functional deficits; unable to tolerate intensive rehabilitation; needs skilled nursing care |
| **Long-term acute care (LTAC)** | Prolonged ventilator dependence; complex medical needs |
| **Transfer to comprehensive stroke center** | LVO needing thrombectomy not available locally; neurosurgical intervention needed; complex case |
