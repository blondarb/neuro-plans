## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Disposition | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Discharge home | Minor stroke (NIHSS 0-3) with stable exam, adequate support at home, able to perform ADLs or with home health, completed workup or reliable outpatient follow-up arranged, medications filled |
| Admit to stroke unit/floor | Moderate stroke (NIHSS 4-15), requires IV medications or ongoing monitoring, incomplete workup, dysphagia requiring NPO/modified diet, new atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulation initiation |
| Admit to ICU/neuro-ICU | Post-tPA monitoring (first 24h), post-thrombectomy, large territory infarct with edema risk, posterior fossa stroke with herniation risk, unstable BP requiring IV antihypertensives, declining neurologic exam, respiratory compromise |
| Transfer to higher level of care | LVO needing thrombectomy (transfer to comprehensive stroke center), need for neurosurgical intervention not available, need for neuro-ICU not available |
| Inpatient rehabilitation | Moderate-severe deficits (NIHSS >4), able to participate in 3h/day therapy, expected to benefit from intensive rehab, medically stable |
| Skilled nursing facility (SNF) | Unable to tolerate 3h/day rehab, needs skilled nursing care, medically complex requiring ongoing monitoring |
| Home with outpatient therapy | Mild deficits, safe home environment, reliable follow-up, family support available |

| Door-to-physician | ≤10 minutes |
| Door-to-CT completion | ≤25 minutes |
| Door-to-CT interpretation | ≤45 minutes |
| Door-to-needle (tPA) | ≤45 minutes (target), ≤60 minutes (acceptable) |

**APPENDIX: NIHSS QUICK REFERENCE**

| Score Range | Severity | General Prognosis |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| 0 | No deficit | Excellent |
| 1-4 | Minor stroke | Good; consider DAPT |
| 5-15 | Moderate stroke | Consider tPA; may need rehab |
| 16-20 | Moderate-severe | tPA + thrombectomy if LVO; likely inpatient rehab |
| 21-42 | Severe | High mortality/morbidity; goals of care discussion |

**APPENDIX: ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score)**

| Score | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| 10 | Normal CT |
| 7-9 | Small infarct; favorable for intervention |
| 6 | Threshold for thrombectomy eligibility (0-6h window) |
| <6 | Large established infarct; higher hemorrhagic transformation risk |
| 0 | Complete MCA territory infarct |
