**DEFINITIONS:**

- **Asymptomatic Neurocognitive Impairment (ANI):** Acquired impairment in >=2 cognitive domains (>=1 SD below normative mean) without functional impairment; Frascati criteria
- **Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (MND):** Acquired impairment in >=2 cognitive domains (>=1 SD below normative mean) with mild functional impairment; Frascati criteria
- **HIV-Associated Dementia (HAD):** Acquired marked impairment in >=2 cognitive domains (>=2 SD below normative mean) with marked functional impairment in ADLs; Frascati criteria
- **CNS Penetration Effectiveness (CPE) Score:** Ranking system for antiretroviral CNS penetration (1 = low, 4 = high); higher total CPE score associated with better CSF viral suppression

## NOTES

- HAND is a diagnosis of exclusion -- all confounders (depression, substance use, metabolic, OIs, medications) must be systematically excluded before attributing cognitive deficits to HIV
- The most common form of HAND in the ART era is ANI; HAD has decreased dramatically but MND and ANI remain prevalent
- CD4 nadir (not current CD4) is the strongest predictor of HAND; patients with historical deep nadir remain at risk despite immune reconstitution
- CSF viral escape is an underrecognized and treatable cause of cognitive decline in virologically suppressed patients -- always check CSF HIV RNA
- CPE score is a useful but imperfect guide; clinical response and CSF viral suppression matter more than absolute CPE score
- Substance use (especially methamphetamine) is the most potent modifier of HAND and must be addressed alongside ART optimization
- ART adherence is the single most important modifiable factor -- simplify regimens, address barriers, involve case management
- Depression is both a confounder and comorbidity -- screen at every visit, treat aggressively, and reassess cognitive deficits after treatment
- Avoid anticholinergics and benzodiazepines in HAND patients; these worsen cognitive impairment
- Frascati criteria require neuropsychological testing in >=5 cognitive domains with standardized norms; bedside screens are insufficient for diagnosis
- Aging with HIV: as PLWH age, vascular, metabolic, and neurodegenerative contributions to cognitive impairment increasingly overlap with HAND

## APPENDIX A: CNS Penetration Effectiveness (CPE) Score Reference

| CPE Score | Drug Class | Antiretrovirals |
|:---------:|------------|----------------|
| 4 | NRTI | Zidovudine (AZT) |
| 4 | NNRTI | Nevirapine |
| 4 | INSTI | Dolutegravir |
| 3 | NRTI | Abacavir, Emtricitabine |
| 3 | NNRTI | Efavirenz, Etravirine |
| 3 | PI | Darunavir/r, Indinavir/r, Lopinavir/r |
| 3 | CCR5 antagonist | Maraviroc |
| 2 | NRTI | Lamivudine, Stavudine, Tenofovir (TDF) |
| 2 | NNRTI | Rilpivirine |
| 2 | PI | Atazanavir/r, Fosamprenavir/r |
| 2 | INSTI | Raltegravir |
| 1 | NRTI | Didanosine, Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) |
| 1 | PI | Nelfinavir, Ritonavir (full dose), Saquinavir, Tipranavir |
| 1 | INSTI | Elvitegravir, Bictegravir (limited data) |
| 1 | Fusion inhibitor | Enfuvirtide (T-20) |

**Target:** Total regimen CPE score >=7-8 for CNS optimization (sum of all drugs in regimen)

**Example high-CPE regimen:** Dolutegravir (4) + Abacavir (3) + Lamivudine (2) = CPE 9

**Note:** CPE score is a guide, not a mandate. Clinical response and CSF viral suppression are the definitive measures of CNS treatment success. Some studies show conflicting results regarding CPE and neurocognitive outcomes.
