# Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** January 30, 2026
**REVISED:** January 30, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)

**ICD-10:** A81.00 (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, unspecified), A81.01 (Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), A81.09 (Other Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), A81.1 (Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis), A81.9 (Atypical virus infections of CNS, unspecified)

**CPT CODES:** 70553 (MRI brain with and without contrast), 95816 (EEG routine), 95950 (cEEG monitoring), 89051 (CSF cell count), 84157 (CSF protein), 82945 (CSF glucose), 83519 (14-3-3 protein, tau, NfL), 86235 (RT-QuIC), 81479 (PRNP gene sequencing), 88305 (Brain biopsy pathology), 70450 (CT head without contrast)

**SYNONYMS:** Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, CJD, sporadic CJD, sCJD, variant CJD, vCJD, familial CJD, fCJD, iatrogenic CJD, iCJD, prion disease, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, TSE, mad cow disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy related, BSE-related CJD, spongiform encephalopathy, prion encephalopathy, Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, subacute spongiform encephalopathy, rapid cognitive decline with myoclonus, prion dementia, human prion disease

**SCOPE:** Diagnostic workup, symptomatic management, and palliative care for suspected or confirmed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease across all subtypes (sporadic, familial/genetic, iatrogenic, variant). Covers WHO/CDC diagnostic criteria application, biomarker interpretation (RT-QuIC, 14-3-3, tau), neuroimaging (MRI DWI cortical ribboning), EEG (periodic sharp wave complexes), PRNP genotyping, myoclonus management, infection control (prion decontamination), palliative care initiation, family counseling, genetic counseling for familial forms, and autopsy/National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center referral. No disease-modifying treatment exists -- management is entirely supportive and palliative. For comprehensive RPD evaluation including treatable mimics, use the "Rapidly Progressive Dementia" template. For autoimmune encephalitis (key differential), use the "Autoimmune Encephalitis" template.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**

- **Sporadic CJD (sCJD):** Most common form (~85-90% of cases); arises spontaneously without identifiable risk factor; median age of onset 62 years; median survival 5-6 months
- **Familial/Genetic CJD (fCJD):** ~10-15% of cases; autosomal dominant PRNP mutations (E200K most common); includes familial CJD, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal familial insomnia (FFI)
- **Iatrogenic CJD (iCJD):** Transmission via contaminated surgical instruments, corneal transplants, dura mater grafts, human-derived growth hormone; extremely rare since modern precautions
- **Variant CJD (vCJD):** Linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE/"mad cow disease"); younger onset (median age 28); prominent psychiatric symptoms early; "pulvinar sign" on MRI; primarily in UK/Europe; extremely rare currently

|-------|--------|----------------|-------------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| MRI brain with and without contrast (CPT 70553) + DWI/FLAIR | Within 24h. DWI is CRITICAL -- cortical ribboning on DWI is highly characteristic of CJD. 3T preferred for sensitivity | sCJD: cortical ribboning on DWI (high signal in neocortex) + caudate/putamen signal on DWI/FLAIR. vCJD: pulvinar sign (bilateral pulvinar thalamic high signal). fCJD: variable by mutation.

### LUMBAR PUNCTURE

**Indication:** Essential for CJD diagnostic workup. CSF RT-QuIC is the gold standard biomarker for prion disease (sensitivity 92%, specificity 99-100%). Also needed to exclude treatable RPD mimics (autoimmune encephalitis, infection, malignancy).

**Timing:** URGENT. Perform early in workup after CT head rules out contraindications. Do not delay for MRI.

**Volume Required:** 15-20 mL (multiple specialized tests required; save extra frozen at -80 degrees C for future studies)

| Study | Rationale | Target Finding | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-------|-----------|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Opening pressure | Elevated ICP assessment; typically normal in CJD | Normal (10-20 cm H2O); normal in CJD | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| Cell count with differential (tubes 1 and 4) (CPT 89051) | Normal or minimal pleocytosis in CJD; elevated WBC suggests autoimmune or infectious etiology | Normal in CJD (WBC <5); elevated WBC suggests non-prion diagnosis | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| Protein (CPT 84157) | Mildly elevated or normal in CJD; markedly elevated suggests infection/autoimmune | Normal or mildly elevated in CJD (usually <100 mg/dL) | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| Glucose with paired serum glucose (CPT 82945) | Low in bacterial/TB/fungal meningitis, carcinomatous meningitis; normal in CJD | Normal in CJD (>60% of serum) | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| Gram stain and bacterial culture (CPT 87205+87070) | Exclude chronic bacterial infection | No organisms | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| **RT-QuIC (real-time quaking-induced conversion) (CPT 86235)** | GOLD STANDARD for CJD diagnosis. Sensitivity 92%, specificity 99-100%. Detects misfolded prion protein amplification. Send to National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (Cleveland) or Quest/Mayo | Negative (positive = prion disease essentially confirmed) | URGENT | URGENT | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| 14-3-3 protein (CPT 83519) | Elevated in rapid neuronal destruction. Sensitivity ~90% for sCJD but NOT specific (also elevated in stroke, encephalitis, seizures, CNS lymphoma). Largely superseded by RT-QuIC | Negative (positive supports CJD in right clinical context but has significant false-positive rate) | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| Total tau protein (CPT 83519) | Markedly elevated in CJD (>1150 pg/mL has sensitivity 90%, specificity 86%). Higher levels correlate with more rapid progression. Not specific (also elevated in AD, stroke) | Normal (<400 pg/mL); CJD often >1150, frequently >10,000 pg/mL | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) | Elevated in CJD (>35 ng/mL); marker of neuronal damage; less specific than tau or RT-QuIC | Normal (<35 ng/mL); elevated in CJD | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

| Alzheimer biomarkers (CSF Abeta42, Abeta40, p-tau 181, t-tau) (CPT 83519) | Rapidly progressive AD (rpAD) is the most common misdiagnosis of CJD. AD pattern: low Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio + elevated p-tau. In CJD: t-tau markedly elevated but p-tau NOT proportionally elevated (p-tau/t-tau ratio very low) | Context-dependent; p-tau/t-tau ratio helps distinguish CJD from rpAD | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Oligoclonal bands (CPT 83916), IgG index | Intrathecal antibody synthesis (MS, autoimmune, neurosarcoidosis); typically absent in CJD | Absent in CJD; present suggests inflammatory/autoimmune etiology | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| HSV 1/2 PCR (CPT 87529) | HSV encephalitis mimic | Negative | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | URGENT |

**Special Handling:** RT-QuIC requires specific collection and shipping procedures -- contact National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (1-216-368-0587) or reference lab for specimen requirements. Send CSF on dry ice. Standard prion precautions NOT required for CSF handling (prion concentration in CSF is very low). Save 5-10 mL of CSF frozen at -80 degrees C for future studies.

**Contraindications:** Elevated ICP without imaging (get CT first); coagulopathy (INR >1.5, platelets <50K); skin infection at LP site; posterior fossa mass with herniation risk

## 3. TREATMENT

*There is NO disease-modifying treatment for CJD. All management is symptomatic and palliative. The primary goals are comfort, dignity, seizure/myoclonus control, and family support.*

### 3A. Acute/Emergent

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Lorazepam (acute seizure) | IV | Acute seizure or status epilepticus | 4 mg :: IV :: PRN seizure :: 0.1 mg/kg IV (max 4 mg/dose); may repeat x1 in 5 min; max 8 mg total | Respiratory depression; acute narrow-angle glaucoma | Respiratory status; sedation level; airway patency | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Levetiracetam (seizure management) | IV | Seizure prophylaxis and treatment in CJD; preferred first-line ASM due to minimal drug interactions | 1000 mg :: IV :: BID :: Load 1000-1500 mg IV; maintenance 500-1500 mg PO/IV BID; max 3000 mg/day | Severe renal impairment (dose adjust per CrCl) | Behavioral changes; renal function; seizure frequency | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Thiamine (B1) IV -- empiric | IV | Empiric for Wernicke encephalopathy while RPD workup pending; treat before glucose | 500 mg :: IV :: TID :: 500 mg IV TID x 3 days, then 250 mg IV daily x 3-5 days, then 100 mg PO daily | None significant | Clinical response (confusion, ataxia, ophthalmoplegia) | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| IV methylprednisolone (empiric trial) | IV | Empiric immunotherapy trial ONLY if autoimmune encephalitis remains in differential; do NOT continue if CJD confirmed (steroids do not help CJD) | 1000 mg :: IV :: daily :: 1000 mg IV daily x 3-5 days; infuse over 1-2 hours; DISCONTINUE if CJD confirmed | Active untreated infection; CJD confirmed (no benefit); uncontrolled diabetes | Glucose q6h; BP; GI prophylaxis; clinical response assessment | - | URGENT | - | URGENT |

*Note: Empiric immunotherapy should be considered ONLY when autoimmune encephalitis has not been ruled out. If RT-QuIC is positive or clinical/imaging profile strongly favors CJD, steroids provide no benefit and should not be given. The critical decision point is whether treatable causes have been adequately excluded.*

## APPENDIX A: CDC DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR SPORADIC CJD (2018 Update)

### Definite sCJD
- Diagnosed by standard neuropathological techniques; and/or
- Immunocytochemically confirmed PrP-positive; and/or
- Western blot confirmed protease-resistant PrP; and/or
- Presence of scrapie-associated fibrils

### Probable sCJD
Requires: **Progressive neuropsychiatric disorder** AND at least ONE of:
1. **Positive RT-QuIC** (CSF or other tissue)
2. **Positive 14-3-3 CSF** AND clinical duration <2 years
3. **Typical MRI signal** (caudate/putamen OR >=2 cortical regions on DWI/FLAIR)
4. **Typical EEG** (periodic sharp wave complexes)

PLUS at least **TWO** of the following clinical features:
- Myoclonus
- Visual or cerebellar disturbance
- Pyramidal or extrapyramidal dysfunction
- Akinetic mutism

AND routine investigations should not suggest an alternative diagnosis.

### Possible sCJD
- Progressive dementia
- Duration <2 years
- At least TWO of the four clinical features above
- No positive result on any of the four diagnostic tests
- Routine investigations do not suggest alternative diagnosis

## APPENDIX B: VARIANT CJD (vCJD) DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

### Definite vCJD
- Confirmed by neuropathological examination (florid plaques, PrP immunostaining pattern)

### Probable vCJD
**I. Clinical criteria (ALL 5 required):**
1. Progressive neuropsychiatric disorder
2. Duration >6 months
3. Routine investigations do not suggest an alternative diagnosis
4. No history of potential iatrogenic exposure
5. No evidence of familial form of TSE

**II. Clinical features (at least 4 of 5):**
- Early psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety, apathy, withdrawal, delusions)
- Persistent painful sensory symptoms (pain, dysesthesia)
- Ataxia
- Myoclonus or chorea or dystonia
- Dementia

**III. Diagnostic tests:**
- EEG does NOT show typical sCJD pattern (PSWCs usually absent in vCJD)
- **Pulvinar sign** on MRI (bilateral pulvinar high signal, sensitivity ~90%)
- Tonsil biopsy positive for PrP (if performed)

## APPENDIX C: PRNP CODON 129 GENOTYPE AND sCJD SUBTYPES

| Subtype | Codon 129 | PrP Type | Clinical Phenotype | Typical Duration |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| MM1 (most common, ~70%) | MM | Type 1 | Classic: rapid cognitive decline, myoclonus, PSWCs on EEG, cortical ribboning on MRI | 3-4 months |
| VV2 | VV | Type 2 | Ataxic variant: prominent cerebellar ataxia early; dementia later; longer course | 6-7 months |
| MV2K | MV | Type 2 | Kuru-type: ataxia, dementia, prolonged course; may lack typical EEG findings | 17-18 months |
| MM2C | MM | Type 2 | Cortical: progressive dementia without typical EEG or MRI in early stages | 15-16 months |
| MM2T | MM | Type 2 | Thalamic (sporadic fatal insomnia): insomnia, autonomic dysfunction, resembles FFI | 15-30 months |
| VV1 (rare) | VV | Type 1 | Early onset; slowly progressive dementia; may lack myoclonus | 15-21 months |

*Note: Codon 129 MM homozygosity is a risk factor for sCJD and is present in ~70% of sCJD cases (vs ~37% of the general population). The molecular classification combines codon 129 genotype with PrP type (determined at autopsy) to define clinicopathological subtypes with distinct clinical presentations and prognosis.*

## APPENDIX D: PRION DECONTAMINATION PROTOCOLS

| Tissue Category | Infectivity Level | Decontamination Required |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Brain, spinal cord, posterior eye | HIGH | WHO-recommended: 1N NaOH for 1 hour at room temperature followed by autoclaving at 134 degrees C for 1 hour in gravity displacement autoclave; OR destroy instruments |
| CSF, anterior eye, olfactory mucosa | LOW-MODERATE | Standard precautions for handling; standard sterilization generally acceptable for instruments not contacting tissue directly |
| Blood, urine, feces, saliva, skin | LOW/NEGLIGIBLE | Standard precautions only; no special decontamination |
| Environmental surfaces | NEGLIGIBLE | Standard cleaning; 1N NaOH or 20,000 ppm sodium hypochlorite for 1 hour if contaminated with high-infectivity tissue |

**Key Principles:**
- Standard autoclaving (121 degrees C for 15-30 min) does NOT reliably inactivate prions
- Formaldehyde, ethanol, ethylene oxide, UV light, and ionizing radiation do NOT inactivate prions
- Single-use disposable instruments are PREFERRED for any invasive procedure on CJD patients
- Contact hospital infection control before ANY invasive procedure on confirmed or suspected CJD patients
