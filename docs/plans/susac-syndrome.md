# Susac Syndrome

**VERSION:** 1.2
**CREATED:** February 2, 2026
**REVISED:** February 2, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Susac Syndrome

**ICD-10:** H35.89 (Other specified retinal disorders -- branch retinal artery occlusion component), I67.89 (Other cerebrovascular disease -- cerebral endotheliopathy), H93.09 (Unspecified degenerative and vascular disorders of ear -- sensorineural hearing loss component)

**CPT CODES:** 70553 (MRI brain with/without contrast), 92235 (fluorescein angiography), 92250 (fundus photography), 92557 (comprehensive audiometry), 92588 (distortion product otoacoustic emissions), 89051 (CSF cell count with differential), 84157 (CSF protein), 96365 (IV infusion first hour -- IVIG/steroids), 96366 (IV infusion each additional hour), 36514 (therapeutic apheresis/plasma exchange), 95816 (EEG routine), 95950 (continuous EEG monitoring), 92083 (visual field testing), 85025 (CBC with differential), 80053 (CMP)

**SYNONYMS:** Susac syndrome, SuS, retinocochleocerebral vasculopathy, small vessel occlusive disease triad, Susac's syndrome, RED-M syndrome (retinopathy-encephalopathy-deafness associated microangiopathy), autoimmune endotheliopathy, retinal-cochlear-cerebral vasculopathy, branch retinal artery occlusion with encephalopathy, Susac triad, corpus callosum microangiopathy syndrome

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis, immunotherapy, and long-term monitoring of Susac syndrome -- an autoimmune endotheliopathy affecting small vessels of the brain, retina, and cochlea. Covers the classic clinical triad (encephalopathy with corpus callosum lesions, branch retinal artery occlusion, sensorineural hearing loss), diagnostic workup including MRI with characteristic "snowball" corpus callosum lesions, fluorescein angiography, audiometry, CSF analysis, and immunotherapy (IVIG, high-dose corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and long-term immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, or rituximab). Includes differentiation from multiple sclerosis, CNS vasculitis, ADEM, and other autoimmune encephalopathies. Not all patients present with the complete triad simultaneously; a high index of suspicion is required. For primary CNS vasculitis, use "CNS Vasculitis (PACNS)" template. For autoimmune encephalitis with antibody-mediated mechanisms, use "Autoimmune Encephalitis" template. For MS, use "MS - New Diagnosis" template.

### LUMBAR PUNCTURE (CPT 62270)

**Indication:** Important for Susac syndrome evaluation and exclusion of alternative diagnoses. CSF in Susac syndrome typically shows elevated protein with mild or no pleocytosis -- distinct from the significant pleocytosis seen in PACNS and infectious etiologies. CSF helps exclude MS, infections, and CNS vasculitis.

**Timing:** URGENT after CT head excludes mass effect; do not delay if clinical suspicion is high

**Volume Required:** 15-20 mL (extra for cytology, cultures, and OCB)

| Study | Rationale | Target Finding | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |

| Myelin basic protein (CSF) (CPT 83873) | Elevated reflecting white matter damage; nonspecific | Mildly elevated | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

**Special Handling:** Oligoclonal bands require paired serum sample drawn within 1 hour. Cytology requires rapid transport (<1 hour). Store extra CSF (frozen at -80C) for future testing. Serial LP is useful to monitor protein levels during treatment.

**Contraindications:** Elevated ICP without imaging (obtain CT first); coagulopathy (INR >1.5, platelets <50K); skin infection at LP site; posterior fossa mass

*The standard acute regimen for Susac syndrome is aggressive early combination of high-dose IV corticosteroids PLUS IVIG. Unlike PACNS, Susac syndrome responds best to early aggressive immunotherapy and has a high risk of irreversible damage (hearing loss, visual loss, cognitive impairment) if treatment is delayed. IVIG is particularly important in Susac syndrome due to its immunomodulatory effects on endothelial cell antibodies. Initiate plasma exchange if there is inadequate response to steroids + IVIG within 48-72 hours.*

*Plasma exchange is early in the treatment algorithm for Susac syndrome when there is inadequate response to steroids + IVIG. Rituximab has emerging evidence for refractory cases and is increasingly used. Cyclophosphamide is reserved for fulminant or severe refractory disease. Natalizumab and infliximab have only case reports supporting their use. Individualize the choice of second-line agent based on disease severity, organ involvement pattern, and prior treatment response.*

### 3D. Disease-Modifying Therapies (Maintenance)

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Pre-Treatment Requirements | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |

*The standard maintenance regimen for Susac syndrome is IVIG (monthly or every 4 weeks) PLUS an oral immunosuppressant (mycophenolate mofetil preferred) PLUS a slow prednisone taper. Susac syndrome has a relapsing-remitting course in many patients, and premature withdrawal of immunotherapy leads to relapse with cumulative end-organ damage (hearing, vision, cognition). European expert consensus recommends minimum 2 years of treatment, with some patients requiring indefinite immunotherapy. Serial MRI, audiometry, and fluorescein angiography guide treatment duration.*

## CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT NOTES

### Diagnostic Criteria for Susac Syndrome (European Susac Consortium 2016)

**Definite Susac Syndrome:**
All three features present:
- [ ] Encephalopathy with characteristic MRI findings (central corpus callosum "snowball" lesions on sagittal FLAIR)
- [ ] Branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) confirmed on fluorescein angiography
- [ ] Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) confirmed on audiometry (low/mid-frequency predominance)

**Probable Susac Syndrome:**
Two of three features present with characteristic findings:
- [ ] Two of three clinical features (encephalopathy + BRAO, encephalopathy + SNHL, or BRAO + SNHL)
- [ ] At least one feature with pathognomonic findings (central callosal snowballs on MRI, arteriolar wall hyperfluorescence on FA, or low-frequency SNHL)

**Possible Susac Syndrome:**
- [ ] One feature with highly suggestive findings (e.g., encephalopathy with central callosal snowball lesions but no BRAO or SNHL yet documented)

*NOTE: The complete triad is not present simultaneously at onset in most cases. Up to 85% of patients do NOT present with the full triad initially. Serial monitoring (FA, audiometry) is essential even in patients presenting with only encephalopathy, as BRAO and SNHL develop over weeks to months.*

### Susac Syndrome vs. Multiple Sclerosis: Key Differentiating Features

| Feature | Susac Syndrome | Multiple Sclerosis |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Corpus callosum lesions | Central fibers ("snowball" pattern); sagittal FLAIR pathognomonic | Calloso-septal interface (Dawson fingers); perpendicular to ventricles |
| Retinal disease | BRAO (arteriolar wall hyperfluorescence on FA) | Optic neuritis (optic nerve, not retinal artery) |
| Hearing loss | SNHL; low and mid-frequency predominance | Rare; if present, retrocochlear pattern |
| CSF | Mild pleocytosis or normal; elevated protein; OCBs often absent | Prominent OCBs (>95%); IgG index elevated |
| Age/Sex | 20-50 years; 3:1 female predominance | 20-40 years; 2-3:1 female predominance |
| Course | Self-limited (monocyclic), polycyclic, or chronic; tends to burn out over 2-4 years | Relapsing-remitting or progressive; lifelong |
| Treatment response | IVIG-responsive; steroids alone often insufficient | DMTs (interferons, natalizumab, ocrelizumab); IVIG not standard |
| Spinal cord | Not typically involved | Spinal cord lesions in >80% |

### Pathognomonic MRI Findings in Susac Syndrome

**Corpus Callosum Lesions (Sagittal FLAIR):**
- "Snowball" lesions: 3-7 mm round lesions in the CENTRAL fibers of the corpus callosum
- "Icicle" or "spoke" lesions: lesions hanging from the inferior surface of the corpus callosum
- "Holes" in the corpus callosum: chronic lesion pattern with callosal atrophy
- Key distinction: MS lesions involve the INFERIOR (calloso-septal) interface; Susac involves the CENTRAL fibers
- Sagittal FLAIR and sagittal T2 are critical sequences (axial imaging misses characteristic pattern)

**Other CNS Lesions:**
- Deep gray matter involvement (thalamus, basal ganglia, internal capsule)
- Periventricular white matter (overlaps with MS pattern)
- Posterior fossa (cerebellum, brainstem)
- Leptomeningeal enhancement (in active disease)
- DWI restriction indicates acute/active ischemic lesions

### Disease Course Patterns

| Pattern | Frequency | Description | Prognosis |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Monocyclic | ~30% | Single episode of active disease followed by remission; no relapses | Best prognosis; taper and discontinue treatment after 2 years of stability |
| Polycyclic | ~40% | Multiple episodes of active disease with remissions between relapses | Intermediate; cumulative damage with each relapse; longer treatment needed |
| Chronic continuous | ~30% | Persistent smoldering disease activity without clear remissions | Worst prognosis; highest risk of cumulative hearing, visual, and cognitive damage; requires indefinite treatment |

### Red Flags Suggesting Susac Syndrome Over Other Diagnoses

- [ ] Young woman (20-40 years) with subacute encephalopathy and multifocal white matter lesions
- [ ] Central corpus callosum "snowball" lesions on sagittal MRI FLAIR (pathognomonic)
- [ ] Branch retinal artery occlusion (not central RAO, not optic neuritis) on fluorescein angiography
- [ ] Low and mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (not high-frequency presbycusis)
- [ ] CSF with elevated protein but minimal or no pleocytosis (unlike PACNS)
- [ ] Absent or few oligoclonal bands (unlike MS)
- [ ] Normal conventional angiography (unlike PACNS -- Susac is a small vessel disease below angiographic resolution)
- [ ] Arteriolar wall hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography (pathognomonic of endothelial damage)
- [ ] Psychiatric symptoms or personality change as early encephalopathic feature
- [ ] Incomplete triad at presentation -- maintain high suspicion and repeat FA/audiometry serially

## APPENDIX A: Susac Syndrome Diagnostic Algorithm

1. **Clinical suspicion** -- Encephalopathy (especially with psychiatric features or cognitive decline) + any combination of visual symptoms and/or hearing loss in a young patient
2. **MRI brain with sagittal FLAIR** -- Look for central corpus callosum "snowball" lesions (pathognomonic); DWI for acute lesions; deep gray matter and white matter involvement
3. **Fluorescein angiography** -- BRAO with arteriolar wall hyperfluorescence (pathognomonic); perform even if NO visual symptoms (subclinical BRAO in up to 50%)
4. **Comprehensive audiometry** -- Low/mid-frequency SNHL; perform even if NO hearing symptoms (subclinical SNHL common)
5. **Lumbar puncture** -- Elevated protein with mild/no pleocytosis; distinguish from PACNS (high pleocytosis) and MS (OCBs)
6. **Exclude mimics** -- MRA/DSA (normal in Susac); autoimmune panel (ANA, ANCA, APL); infection panel (RPR, VZV, HIV)
7. **Classify** -- Definite (all 3 features), Probable (2 of 3), Possible (1 with characteristic findings)
8. **Initiate treatment** -- Do NOT wait for complete triad; early aggressive therapy prevents irreversible damage

---

## APPENDIX B: Susac Syndrome Treatment Protocol (Rennebohm Protocol)

**Phase 1: Acute Induction (Weeks 1-4)**
- IV methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily x 3-5 days
- IVIG 2 g/kg IV divided over 5 days
- Aspirin 81 mg PO daily
- Begin oral prednisone taper after IV pulse (1 mg/kg/day)
- Begin mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg PO BID, increase to 1000 mg BID over 2 weeks

**Phase 2: Consolidation (Months 1-6)**
- IVIG 2 g/kg IV divided over 2-5 days every 4 weeks
- Mycophenolate mofetil 1000-1500 mg PO BID (target 2000-3000 mg/day)
- Prednisone taper: reduce by 10 mg every 2 weeks to 20 mg; then 5 mg every 2 weeks to 10 mg
- Aspirin 81 mg PO daily
- PJP prophylaxis; bone protection

**Phase 3: Maintenance (Months 6-24+)**
- IVIG 2 g/kg IV every 4 weeks (extend to q6-8 weeks after 12 months of stability)
- Mycophenolate mofetil 1000-1500 mg PO BID
- Prednisone target: off or lowest effective dose (typically <10 mg/day)
- Aspirin 81 mg PO daily
- Serial monitoring: MRI q6 months, FA q6 months, audiometry q6 months

**Phase 4: Taper/Discontinuation (After 24+ months of stability)**
- Taper IVIG frequency: q4 weeks to q6 weeks to q8 weeks to q12 weeks to discontinue
- Taper mycophenolate after IVIG discontinued: reduce by 500 mg every 3-6 months
- Continue serial monitoring q6 months during taper and q6-12 months after discontinuation
- Reinitiate treatment promptly if relapse detected (new MRI lesion, new BRAO, new hearing loss)
