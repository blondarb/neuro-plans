# Dementia Evaluation

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 29, 2026
**REVISED:** January 29, 2026
**STATUS:** Complete

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Dementia Evaluation / Cognitive Impairment Workup

**ICD-10:** R41.81 (Age-related cognitive decline), F03.90 (Unspecified dementia without behavioral disturbance), G30.9 (Alzheimer's disease, unspecified), F01.50 (Vascular dementia without behavioral disturbance), G31.83 (Dementia with Lewy bodies), G31.09 (Other frontotemporal dementia), G31.84 (Mild cognitive impairment)

**SYNONYMS:** Dementia, cognitive impairment, memory loss, cognitive decline, major neurocognitive disorder, mild neurocognitive disorder, senility, organic brain syndrome, dementia workup

**SCOPE:** Systematic evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia in adults. Covers comprehensive workup to identify reversible causes and establish etiology. Includes initiation of symptomatic treatment. Excludes pediatric intellectual disability, acute delirium (separate entity), and rapidly progressive dementia (separate template for urgent workup).

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Dementia (Major Neurocognitive Disorder):** Significant cognitive decline from prior level in ≥1 cognitive domains (memory, language, executive function, attention, perceptual-motor, social cognition) that interferes with independence in everyday activities
- **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI):** Modest cognitive decline that does NOT interfere with independence; intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia
- **Reversible Dementia:** Cognitive impairment due to treatable conditions (B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, NPH, depression, medication effects)

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

## NOTES

- Dementia is a clinical diagnosis; workup identifies etiology and reversible causes
- "Reversible dementia" accounts for ~10% of cases; always screen for B12, thyroid, medications
- Cholinesterase inhibitors provide modest symptomatic benefit; do not alter disease course
- Anti-amyloid therapies (lecanemab, donanemab) are disease-modifying but modest effect; require amyloid confirmation, MRI monitoring for ARIA
- DLB patients extremely sensitive to antipsychotics - avoid or use quetiapine cautiously
- Involve family/caregivers in all visits; caregiver burnout is common
- Advance care planning should occur early while patient can participate
- "No anticholinergics" in dementia patients - review all medications
