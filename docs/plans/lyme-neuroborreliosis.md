### LUMBAR PUNCTURE

**Indication:** ALL patients with suspected neuroborreliosis and CNS symptoms (meningitis, encephalopathy, myelopathy). Recommended for patients with cranial neuropathy (especially bilateral facial palsy) to distinguish CNS involvement from peripheral nerve disease. LP helps determine whether IV (vs. oral) antibiotics are needed. CSF pleocytosis with intrathecal antibody production is the diagnostic hallmark.

**Timing:** URGENT in ED/inpatient if meningitis, encephalopathy, or myelopathy suspected. ROUTINE for outpatient evaluation of isolated facial palsy or late neuroborreliosis symptoms.

**Volume Required:** 10-15 mL (standard diagnostic)

| Study | Rationale | Target Finding | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-------|-----------|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Opening pressure | Rule out elevated ICP; usually normal or mildly elevated in Lyme meningitis | Normal or mildly elevated (10-20 cm H2O) | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Cell count with differential (tubes 1 and 4) (CPT 89051) | CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis is the hallmark of neuroborreliosis; typically 10-1000 WBC/uL (lymphocyte predominant); distinguishes from bacterial meningitis | WBC typically 10-1000 cells/uL (lymphocyte predominant >80%); plasma cells may be present (suggestive of Lyme) | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Protein (CPT 84157) | Elevated in neuroborreliosis (50-300 mg/dL typically) | Elevated (>45 mg/dL); typically 50-300 mg/dL | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Glucose with paired serum glucose (CPT 82945) | Usually normal in Lyme meningitis (distinguishes from bacterial and TB meningitis where glucose is low) | Normal (>60% serum glucose ratio); low glucose suggests bacterial or TB meningitis, NOT Lyme | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Gram stain and bacterial culture (CPT 87205+87070) | Exclude bacterial meningitis in acute presentation | No organisms | STAT | ROUTINE | - | - |
| CSF Lyme antibody index (CPT 86618) | GOLD STANDARD for neuroborreliosis diagnosis; compares CSF:serum antibody ratio to determine intrathecal antibody production; elevated index confirms CNS infection (not just passive diffusion from serum) | Elevated CSF:serum antibody index (>1.0-1.3 depending on lab) confirms intrathecal antibody production = neuroborreliosis | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| CSF Lyme IgM and IgG antibodies (CPT 86618) | Detect Borrelia-specific antibodies in CSF; must be interpreted alongside serum antibodies (CSF:serum index); isolated CSF positivity without elevated index may represent passive diffusion | Positive CSF Lyme antibodies (interpret with antibody index) | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| BioFire FilmArray ME Panel (CPT 87483) | Rapid multiplex PCR to exclude viral and bacterial meningitis pathogens; does NOT detect Borrelia | Negative (excludes common viral/bacterial pathogens) | STAT | ROUTINE | - | - |
| Oligoclonal bands, IgG index (CPT 83916) | Intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis; positive in neuroborreliosis; also positive in MS (differential) | Often positive (intrathecal IgG synthesis); not specific | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| VDRL (CSF) (CPT 86592) | Exclude neurosyphilis (chronic lymphocytic meningitis differential) | Non-reactive | STAT | ROUTINE | - | - |
| Cytology (CPT 88104) | Leptomeningeal malignancy in differential for chronic meningitis | Negative | - | ROUTINE | - | - |
| AFB smear and culture (CPT 87116) | TB meningitis in differential if chronic lymphocytic meningitis | Negative | - | ROUTINE | - | - |

**Special Handling:** CSF Lyme antibody index requires paired serum and CSF samples drawn at the same time for accurate calculation. Ensure lab receives BOTH specimens labeled appropriately. CSF Lyme PCR has low sensitivity; antibody index is preferred.

**Contraindications to LP:** Coagulopathy (INR >1.5, platelets <50K) -- correct first if possible. Mass lesion with midline shift (CT first). Signs of impending herniation.

**Diagnostic Interpretation Guide:**

| Serum Lyme Serology | CSF Pleocytosis | CSF Lyme Antibody Index | Interpretation |
|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| Positive (two-tier) | Yes (lymphocytic) | Elevated | Confirmed neuroborreliosis |
| Positive (two-tier) | Yes (lymphocytic) | Not elevated or not available | Probable neuroborreliosis (treat as neuroborreliosis in endemic area with compatible syndrome) |
| Positive (two-tier) | No | Not elevated | Seropositive but no active CNS infection; consider alternative diagnosis or prior exposure |
| Negative | Yes (lymphocytic) | N/A | Very early neuroborreliosis possible (seroconversion may take 2-6 weeks); repeat serologies in 2-4 weeks; consider other causes of meningitis |
| Negative | No | N/A | Neuroborreliosis unlikely |

### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Return to ED if: worsening headache, new weakness, vision changes, difficulty breathing, chest pain (Lyme carditis), high fever, or worsening confusion (may indicate disease progression or alternative diagnosis) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE |
| Complete the FULL course of antibiotics as prescribed (14-28 days); do NOT stop treatment early even if symptoms improve, as incomplete treatment may lead to persistent or late neurologic complications | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Facial palsy from Lyme disease has an excellent prognosis; most patients recover fully within weeks to months with appropriate antibiotic treatment; tape affected eye closed at night and use lubricant drops to protect the cornea | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Some symptoms (fatigue, pain, cognitive difficulty) may persist for weeks to months after completing antibiotics (post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome/PTLDS); this does NOT indicate ongoing infection and does NOT require additional antibiotics | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Follow-up with neurology in 2-4 weeks after completing antibiotics for clinical reassessment; additional follow-up at 3 and 6 months to confirm resolution | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Report any new neurologic symptoms (numbness, weakness, cognitive changes, hearing loss, visual changes) between follow-up visits as they may indicate treatment failure or alternative diagnosis | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial nerve palsy) | Unilateral facial weakness without other neurologic findings; no tick exposure or erythema migrans; no meningeal symptoms; BILATERAL facial palsy strongly favors Lyme in endemic areas | Lyme serologies (two-tier); CSF analysis (pleocytosis favors Lyme); MRI brain |
| Viral meningitis (enterovirus, HSV-2, VZV) | Acute febrile illness with headache, neck stiffness; CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis; season (summer/fall for enterovirus); no tick exposure history | BioFire ME panel; viral CSF PCR; Lyme serologies; enterovirus typically has lower CSF protein than Lyme |
| Neurosyphilis | Cranial neuropathies; meningitis; CSF pleocytosis; may be clinically indistinguishable; different risk factors (sexual exposure vs. tick exposure) | RPR/VDRL; FTA-ABS; CSF VDRL; Lyme serologies; may coexist |
| Multiple sclerosis | Relapsing neurologic deficits; optic neuritis; myelopathy; white matter lesions; younger women; oligoclonal bands positive | MRI brain/spine (periventricular lesions, Dawson fingers); CSF oligoclonal bands; Lyme serologies (must exclude in endemic areas before MS diagnosis) |
| Neurosarcoidosis | Cranial neuropathies (CN VII common); chronic meningitis; granulomatous inflammation; systemic involvement (lungs, skin, eyes) | Chest CT (hilar adenopathy); serum/CSF ACE; biopsy; Lyme serologies negative |
| Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) | Ascending symmetric weakness; areflexia; cytoalbuminous dissociation (high protein, normal WBC); facial diplegia variant exists | CSF analysis (GBS: high protein, <5 WBC; Lyme meningitis: elevated WBC AND protein); NCS/EMG; anti-ganglioside antibodies; Lyme serologies |
| Tuberculous meningitis | Subacute chronic meningitis; basilar predominance; cranial neuropathies; very low CSF glucose; very high protein; exposure/travel history | AFB culture; TB PCR (GeneXpert); CSF ADA; chest X-ray; PPD/IGRA; Lyme CSF glucose is NORMAL |
| Sarcoidosis (facial nerve) | Bilateral facial palsy (like Lyme); uveoparotid fever (Heerfordt syndrome); erythema nodosum; no tick exposure | Chest imaging; ACE level; biopsy; Lyme serologies negative |
| Lymphomatous meningitis | Chronic meningitis; cranial neuropathies; constitutional symptoms; immunocompromised host | CSF cytology; flow cytometry; brain MRI with contrast; Lyme serologies negative |
| Autoimmune encephalitis | Subacute psychiatric symptoms; seizures; movement disorders; may present with encephalopathy similar to late neuroborreliosis | Autoimmune encephalitis panel (serum + CSF); MRI; EEG; Lyme serologies |
| West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease | Summer/fall; mosquito exposure; acute flaccid paralysis; meningoencephalitis; CSF pleocytosis | WNV IgM (serum and CSF); Lyme serologies; WNV PCR |

| Serum Lyme serologies (follow-up) | 4-6 weeks after treatment; 3 and 6 months | Declining antibody titers over time (IgM resolves; IgG may persist for years) | Persistent IgG is common and does NOT indicate treatment failure; clinical improvement is the primary measure of treatment response | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Renal function (BUN, Cr) | Baseline, then weekly during IV antibiotics | Stable; CrCl >60 | Dose adjust antibiotics if renal function declines | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |

## APPENDIX A: NEUROBORRELIOSIS CLINICAL SYNDROMES

| Syndrome | Timing After Tick Bite | Key Clinical Features | Typical CSF Findings | Treatment |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Cranial neuropathy (facial palsy) | 2-8 weeks | Unilateral or bilateral (25%) facial weakness; may be only neurologic finding; often preceded by erythema migrans | Lymphocytic pleocytosis (may be absent in isolated peripheral CN VII); normal glucose; mildly elevated protein | Oral doxycycline if no CSF pleocytosis; IV ceftriaxone if CSF pleocytosis present |
| Lymphocytic meningitis | 2-10 weeks | Headache; neck stiffness (often mild); photophobia; low-grade fever; may present with cranial neuropathy | Lymphocytic pleocytosis (10-1000 WBC); elevated protein (50-300); normal glucose; positive Lyme antibody index | IV ceftriaxone 14-21 days |
| Painful radiculoneuropathy (Bannwarth syndrome) | 2-12 weeks | Severe radicular pain (often nocturnal, migratory); motor weakness in affected dermatome; more common in European neuroborreliosis (B. garinii) | Lymphocytic pleocytosis; elevated protein; positive Lyme antibody index | IV ceftriaxone 14-21 days (or oral doxycycline per European guidelines) |
| Acute myelitis | Weeks to months | Spastic paraparesis; sensory level; bladder dysfunction; may mimic transverse myelitis or MS | Lymphocytic pleocytosis; elevated protein; Lyme antibody index elevated | IV ceftriaxone 21-28 days |
| Encephalomyelitis (late) | Months to years | Progressive spastic paraparesis; cognitive decline; cranial neuropathies; white matter lesions on MRI (may mimic MS) | Lymphocytic pleocytosis (may be mild); elevated protein; intrathecal antibody production | IV ceftriaxone 21-28 days |
| Peripheral neuropathy (late) | Months to years | Distal sensory polyneuropathy; asymmetric; often with encephalopathy; intermittent limb paresthesias | CSF may be normal or mildly abnormal | IV ceftriaxone 14-28 days |
| Encephalopathy (late) | Months to years | Subtle cognitive impairment; memory difficulties; fatigue; sleep disturbance; NO CSF pleocytosis (distinguishes from encephalomyelitis) | CSF usually NORMAL; may have elevated protein without pleocytosis | IV ceftriaxone 14-28 days; cognitive rehabilitation |

## APPENDIX B: POST-TREATMENT LYME DISEASE SYNDROME (PTLDS)

**Definition:** Persistent symptoms (fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, cognitive difficulty) lasting >6 months after completion of appropriate antibiotic therapy for confirmed Lyme disease.

**Key Points:**
- Occurs in approximately 10-20% of treated Lyme disease patients
- NOT due to persistent active infection (multiple RCTs demonstrate no benefit of prolonged antibiotics)
- Thought to be related to post-infectious immune dysregulation, not active spirochetal infection
- Symptoms are real and can be debilitating, but are self-limited in most patients

**Management:**
- Supportive care and symptom management only
- Graduated exercise program
- Cognitive behavioral therapy for persistent fatigue and pain
- Sleep hygiene optimization
- Neuropathic pain management if applicable (gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine)
- Neuropsychological rehabilitation for cognitive complaints
- NO role for prolonged, repeated, or combination antibiotics (Class I evidence: Klempner 2001, Krupp 2003, Berende 2016)
- NO role for alternative therapies (bismacine, colloidal silver, ozone therapy, hyperthermia) -- these are harmful and unsupported

**Prognosis:** Most patients with PTLDS improve gradually over months to years. Complete resolution is expected in the majority.
