| Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) | Gait apraxia (magnetic gait); urinary incontinence; cognitive decline (triad); shuffling rather than spastic gait | MRI brain (ventriculomegaly out of proportion to atrophy); lumbar puncture with large-volume tap test (gait improvement) |
| Copper deficiency myelopathy | Mimics B12 deficiency; posterior column + corticospinal tract; history of gastric surgery, zinc supplements, or chronic zinc exposure | Serum copper and ceruloplasmin (low); zinc level (may be elevated); MRI (posterior column T2 signal) |

## APPENDIX B: Surgical Approach Selection Guide

| Clinical Scenario | Preferred Approach | Rationale |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1-2 level anterior compression, maintained lordosis | ACDF | Direct decompression; high fusion rate; good outcomes |
| 2-3 level anterior compression, vertebral body pathology | ACCF (corpectomy) | Wider decompression; addresses OPLL/body involvement |
| ≥3 level compression, maintained lordosis, no kyphosis | Laminoplasty | Preserves motion; avoids anterior approach risks; effective posterior decompression |
| Multi-level compression with instability or kyphosis | Posterior laminectomy + fusion | Addresses instability; deformity correction; instrumented fixation |
| Combined anterior + posterior compression | Combined (staged or same-day) | 360° decompression for severe cases |
| OPLL (continuous or mixed type) | Posterior approach preferred (laminoplasty or laminectomy + fusion) | Avoids risk of OPLL fragment displacement from anterior approach; exception: segmental OPLL may be approached anteriorly |

**Key Factors in Approach Decision:**
- Cervical alignment (lordosis vs kyphosis)
- Number of levels involved
- Location of compression (anterior vs posterior vs circumferential)
- OPLL presence and type
- Patient age and comorbidities
- Bone quality (osteoporosis status)
- Surgeon experience and preference
