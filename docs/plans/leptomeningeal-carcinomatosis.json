Covers initial evaluation and stabilization, CSF diagnosis (cytology, flow cytometry, cell-free DNA), neuroimaging (gadolinium-enhanced MRI brain and spine), intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate, cytarabine, thiotepa) via lumbar puncture or Ommaya reservoir, systemic therapy with CNS penetration, radiation therapy (involved-field, whole-brain, craniospinal), management of hydrocephalus (VP shunt, ETV), steroid management, seizure treatment, pain management, prognostic assessment, and palliative care integration. Excludes primary CNS lymphoma (separate template), primary leptomeningeal gliomatosis, and isolated parenchymal brain metastases without leptomeningeal involvement (see Brain Metastases template).",
