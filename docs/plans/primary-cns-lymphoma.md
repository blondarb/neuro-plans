## 3. TREATMENT

**CRITICAL:** AVOID CORTICOSTEROIDS BEFORE BIOPSY. Dexamethasone causes rapid lympholysis in PCNSL, producing the "vanishing tumor" or "ghost tumor" phenomenon. This can render stereotactic biopsy non-diagnostic and delay definitive treatment by weeks to months. Only administer steroids if the patient has life-threatening herniation or rapidly declining neurologic status where biopsy cannot be performed emergently.

**CRITICAL:** Treatment decisions require coordination between neuro-oncology, hematology/oncology, radiation oncology, neurosurgery, and ophthalmology. PCNSL is highly chemosensitive and radiosensitive, but the blood-brain barrier limits drug delivery. High-dose methotrexate is the cornerstone of treatment.

├── Verify no third-space fluid collections (ascites, pleural effusion)
├── CBC: ANC >1000, platelets >75K
├── LFTs within normal limits
├── Hold TMP-SMX (interferes with MTX excretion)

│   at 200-250 mL/h (2-3 L/m2 over 24h)
└── Verify urine pH >7.0 before starting MTX infusion

MTX INFUSION:
├── Dose: 3.5 g/m2 IV over 4 hours
├── Continue IV hydration during and after infusion
├── Urine pH checks q6h (maintain >7.0)

   brainstem, or cerebellum)

RISK GROUPS:
├── Low risk (0-1 factors):    2-year OS ~80%
├── Intermediate (2-3 factors): 2-year OS ~48%
└── High risk (4-5 factors):   2-year OS ~15%
