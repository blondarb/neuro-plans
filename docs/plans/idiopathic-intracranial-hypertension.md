# Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 29, 2026
**REVISED:** January 29, 2026
**STATUS:** Complete

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension

**ICD-10:** G93.2 (Benign intracranial hypertension), G93.5 (Compression of brain)

**SYNONYMS:** Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, IIH, pseudotumor cerebri, benign intracranial hypertension, primary intracranial hypertension

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in adults including diagnosis, medical management, and surgical interventions. Applies to ED, hospital, and outpatient settings. Excludes secondary causes of elevated ICP.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH):** Syndrome of elevated ICP (≥25 cm H2O in adults) with no identifiable cause, normal CSF composition, and normal neuroimaging except signs of elevated ICP
- **Papilledema:** Optic disc swelling due to elevated ICP; bilateral in most cases
- **Visual Field Defects:** Enlarged blind spot (most common), peripheral constriction, central/cecocentral scotoma (severe)
- **Fulminant IIH:** Rapid visual decline over days to weeks; requires urgent intervention
- **Frisen Scale:** Grading system for papilledema (0-5); 0=normal, 5=severe with obscured vessels
- **Transverse Sinus Stenosis:** Common imaging finding; may be cause or effect of elevated ICP

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

## DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (Modified Dandy Criteria - Friedman 2013)

**Required for IIH Diagnosis:**
1. Papilledema
2. Normal neurologic exam (except CN VI palsy allowed)
3. Neuroimaging: Normal brain parenchyma; no meningeal enhancement; no venous thrombosis (MRV required); may show empty sella, flattened globes, optic nerve sheath distension
4. Normal CSF composition
5. Elevated opening pressure: ≥25 cm H2O in adults (≥28 cm H2O in children)
6. No other cause of intracranial hypertension identified

**IIH Without Papilledema (IIHWOP):**
- Diagnosis possible if unilateral or bilateral CN VI palsy present
- Or if ALL of: typical headache, elevated OP, normal CSF, supportive MRI findings
- Requires more stringent exclusion of secondary causes

---

## NOTES

- IIH typically affects young obese women (BMI >30); male IIH exists but consider secondary causes more carefully
- Vision loss is the most important outcome; headache is common but not the priority
- Papilledema can cause permanent optic atrophy if untreated
- Acetazolamide is first-line; titrate to maximum tolerated dose (up to 4 g/day)
- Weight loss is critical for obese patients; even 5-10% loss can significantly improve IIH
- Fulminant IIH (rapid vision loss over days to weeks) is a neuro-ophthalmic emergency
- ONSF protects vision but does not reduce ICP or headache
- Shunts reduce ICP and headache but have high revision rates (up to 50%+)
- Venous sinus stenting is emerging as effective for selected patients with significant stenosis
- Pregnancy: IIH can develop or worsen; treatment options limited; close monitoring essential
- Discontinue medications that can cause/worsen IIH (vitamin A, tetracyclines, etc.)
- Long-term follow-up required; IIH can recur, especially with weight gain

---
