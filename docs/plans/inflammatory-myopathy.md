## APPENDIX A: MYOSITIS-SPECIFIC ANTIBODY QUICK REFERENCE

| Antibody | Disease Subtype | Key Clinical Features | Malignancy Risk | ILD Risk | Prognosis |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|:---------------:|:--------:|-----------|
| Anti-Jo-1 | Anti-synthetase syndrome | Myositis + ILD + mechanic's hands + arthritis + Raynaud + fever | Low-moderate | HIGH (50-70%) | Moderate; ILD determines outcome |
| Anti-PL-7 | Anti-synthetase syndrome | ILD-predominant; less severe myositis | Low | HIGH | Moderate |
| Anti-PL-12 | Anti-synthetase syndrome | ILD-predominant; minimal myositis | Low | HIGH | Moderate |
| Anti-EJ | Anti-synthetase syndrome | Myositis + ILD | Low | HIGH | Moderate |
| Anti-OJ | Anti-synthetase syndrome | ILD + myositis | Low | HIGH | Moderate |
| Anti-Mi-2 | Classic DM | Heliotrope rash, Gottron papules, V-sign; good steroid response | Low | Low | Good |
| Anti-MDA5 (CADM-140) | Amyopathic DM | Rapidly progressive ILD (HIGH MORTALITY); skin ulcers; palmar papules; minimal myositis; high ferritin | Low | VERY HIGH (fatal if untreated) | Poor without aggressive treatment |
| Anti-TIF1-gamma (p155/140) | DM with malignancy | Classic DM rash; up to 60% malignancy risk in adults >40 | VERY HIGH | Low | Depends on malignancy; DM may remit with cancer treatment |
| Anti-NXP2 (MJ) | DM with calcinosis | Calcinosis (especially juvenile); peripheral edema; severe weakness | Moderate (adults) | Low | Variable |
| Anti-SAE | DM | Initial skin-predominant then develops myopathy; dysphagia common | Low-moderate | Low | Moderate |
| Anti-SRP | IMNM | Severe proximal weakness; very high CK; cardiac involvement; poor steroid response; requires aggressive immunotherapy | Low | Low | Poor without combination therapy |
| Anti-HMGCR | IMNM | Often statin-associated (but can occur without statins); very high CK; severe proximal weakness; requires aggressive immunotherapy | Low | Low | Moderate-poor without combination therapy |

## APPENDIX B: ACR/EULAR CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA (2017)

**Probability-based classification for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM):**

| Variable | Without Biopsy | With Biopsy |
|----------|:--------------:|:-----------:|
| Age at onset >=18 and <40 | 1.3 | 1.5 |
| Age at onset >=40 | 2.1 | 2.2 |
| Male sex | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Female sex | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Muscle weakness (upper extremities proximal) | 0.7 | 0.7 |
| Muscle weakness (lower extremities proximal) | 0.5 | 0.5 |
| Neck flexor weakness | 1.9 | 1.9 |
| Objective symmetric weakness (proximal upper > distal) | 0.6 | 0.6 |
| Dysphagia | 0.7 | 0.7 |
| Heliotrope rash | 3.1 | 3.2 |
| Gottron papules | 2.1 | 2.7 |
| Gottron sign | 3.3 | 3.5 |
| Elevated CK or LDH or AST or ALT | 1.3 | 1.4 |
| Anti-Jo-1 positive | 3.9 | 3.8 |
| Muscle biopsy: endomysial inflammation | - | 1.7 |
| Muscle biopsy: perimysial/perivascular inflammation | - | 1.2 |
| Muscle biopsy: perifascicular atrophy | - | 1.9 |
| Muscle biopsy: rimmed vacuoles | - | 3.1 |

**Score Interpretation:**
- Definite IIM: aggregate score >=7.5 (without biopsy) or >=8.7 (with biopsy)
- Probable IIM: aggregate score >=5.5 (without biopsy) or >=6.7 (with biopsy)
- Possible IIM: aggregate score >=5.3 (without biopsy) or >=6.5 (with biopsy)

**Subclassification:** Once classified as IIM, further classified into DM, PM, IBM, amyopathic DM, or juvenile DM based on specific criteria including rash, biopsy findings, and antibody status.

## APPENDIX C: MALIGNANCY SCREENING PROTOCOL FOR DERMATOMYOSITIS

**Risk stratification:**

| Risk Factor | Screening Level |
|-------------|----------------|
| Anti-TIF1-gamma positive + age >40 | Comprehensive (highest risk) |
| Any adult-onset DM, age >40 | Enhanced |
| DM age 18-40 | Standard age-appropriate |
| PM or IMNM without DM features | Standard age-appropriate |
| Juvenile DM | Standard pediatric |

**Comprehensive malignancy screening (high-risk DM):**

| Screening Test | Timing | Repeat |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast | At diagnosis | Annually x 3 years |
| PET/CT (FDG) | At diagnosis if CT negative | As clinically indicated |
| Mammography (female) | At diagnosis | Annually x 3 years |
| Pelvic ultrasound (female) | At diagnosis | Annually x 3 years |
| CA-125 (female) | At diagnosis | Annually x 3 years |
| PSA (male) | At diagnosis | Annually x 3 years |
| Colonoscopy | At diagnosis (if age >45 or symptoms) | Per gastroenterology |
| Upper endoscopy | If symptoms or nasopharyngeal carcinoma risk (Asian descent) | As indicated |
| Urinalysis with cytology | At diagnosis | Annually x 3 years |
| Complete blood count with differential | At diagnosis | q3-6 months |
| Age-appropriate cancer screening | Per guidelines | Per guidelines |

**Key points:**
- Highest cancer risk is within first 3 years of DM diagnosis
- Most common malignancies: ovarian, lung, breast, GI, pancreatic, nasopharyngeal (geographic variation)
- DM may be a paraneoplastic syndrome; treating underlying malignancy may improve myositis
- Anti-TIF1-gamma negative predictive value is high; absence significantly reduces cancer risk
- Annual screening recommended for minimum 3-5 years after DM diagnosis
