  "scope": "** Evaluation and management of radiation-induced CNS injury in adults. Covers acute radiation injury (during or within days of treatment), early-delayed radiation injury (1-6 months post-radiation), and late-delayed radiation injury including radiation necrosis (months to years post-radiation), radiation myelopathy, cranial neuropathies (optic neuropathy, vestibulocochlear injury, lower cranial nerve palsies), radiation-induced cognitive decline, radiation-induced leukoencephalopathy, radiation-induced cerebrovascular disease (moyamoya, cavernomas, accelerated atherosclerosis), and radiation-induced secondary neoplasms. Includes differentiation of radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence/progression (a critical diagnostic challenge). Excludes acute radiation syndrome from nuclear/radiological emergencies, brachytherapy-specific complications, and pediatric radiation injury (separate templates).",
