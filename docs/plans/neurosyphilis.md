### LUMBAR PUNCTURE

**Indication:** ALL patients with suspected neurosyphilis, confirmed syphilis with neurologic/ophthalmologic/otologic symptoms, HIV-positive with syphilis (especially CD4 <350 or RPR >=1:32), or syphilis with treatment failure. CSF examination is ESSENTIAL for diagnosis and monitoring.

**Timing:** URGENT. Perform before treatment if possible, but do NOT delay IV penicillin if LP will be significantly delayed.

**Volume Required:** 10-15 mL (standard diagnostic)

| Study | Rationale | Target Finding | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-------|-----------|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Opening pressure | Elevated in syphilitic meningitis | Normal or mildly elevated (10-20 cm H2O); elevated in acute meningitis | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Cell count with differential (tubes 1 and 4) (CPT 89051) | CSF pleocytosis is the hallmark of active neurosyphilis; lymphocytic predominant; most sensitive CSF marker | WBC >5 cells/uL (lymphocyte predominant); typically 10-400 cells/uL; elevated WBC is the most sensitive indicator of active CNS infection | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Protein (CPT 84157) | Elevated in neurosyphilis (45-200 mg/dL) | Elevated (>45 mg/dL); typically 50-200 mg/dL | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Glucose with paired serum glucose (CPT 82945) | May be mildly decreased; helps distinguish from other causes of meningitis | Normal or mildly low (>60% serum glucose ratio); markedly low glucose suggests bacterial or TB meningitis | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| CSF VDRL (CPT 86592) | GOLD STANDARD for neurosyphilis diagnosis; highly SPECIFIC (99%) but sensitivity only 30-70%. A REACTIVE CSF VDRL confirms neurosyphilis. A NON-REACTIVE CSF VDRL does NOT exclude neurosyphilis | Reactive = diagnostic of neurosyphilis. Non-reactive does NOT rule out neurosyphilis | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| CSF FTA-ABS (CPT 86780) | More SENSITIVE than CSF VDRL (>95%) but LESS SPECIFIC (false positives from blood contamination). A NEGATIVE CSF FTA-ABS essentially rules out neurosyphilis. Used mainly to EXCLUDE the diagnosis | Non-reactive = neurosyphilis unlikely. Reactive = possible neurosyphilis (but not confirmatory due to lower specificity) | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| CSF RPR | NOT validated for CSF; some labs offer it but CSF VDRL is the standard non-treponemal test for CSF | CSF VDRL preferred; CSF RPR has uncertain performance characteristics | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Gram stain and bacterial culture (CPT 87205+87070) | Exclude bacterial meningitis if acute presentation | No organisms | STAT | ROUTINE | - | - |
| BioFire FilmArray ME Panel (CPT 87483) | Rapid multiplex PCR to exclude bacterial/viral meningitis if acute presentation | Negative (no bacterial or viral pathogen identified) | STAT | ROUTINE | - | - |
| Oligoclonal bands, IgG index (CPT 83916) | Intrathecal antibody production; elevated in neurosyphilis; also elevated in MS (differential) | Often positive (intrathecal IgG synthesis); not specific to syphilis | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| AFB smear and culture (CPT 87116) | TB meningitis in differential (chronic lymphocytic meningitis) | Negative | - | ROUTINE | - | - |
| Cytology (CPT 88104) | Leptomeningeal malignancy in differential | Negative | - | ROUTINE | - | - |
| Cryptococcal antigen (CSF) (CPT 87327) | HIV co-infection; chronic meningitis differential | Negative | - | ROUTINE | - | - |

**Special Handling:** CSF VDRL must be performed on CSF, NOT serum. Ensure lab receives sample labeled for CSF testing. Avoid bloody taps as blood contamination can cause false-positive CSF FTA-ABS.

**Contraindications to LP:** Coagulopathy (INR >1.5, platelets <50K) -- correct first if possible. Mass lesion with midline shift (CT first). Signs of impending herniation.

**Diagnostic Interpretation Guide:**

| CSF VDRL | CSF FTA-ABS | CSF WBC | Interpretation |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Reactive | Reactive | Elevated (>5) | Confirmed neurosyphilis |
| Non-reactive | Reactive | Elevated (>5) | Probable neurosyphilis (treat as neurosyphilis) |
| Non-reactive | Non-reactive | Normal | Neurosyphilis essentially excluded |
| Non-reactive | Reactive | Normal | Possible prior treated neurosyphilis or false positive FTA-ABS; clinical correlation required |
| Reactive | Reactive | Normal | Possible neurosyphilis; monitor closely; consider treatment |

| Abstain from sexual contact until treatment is complete and RPR titers decline to confirm cure; use condoms consistently after treatment | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Safer sex practices: consistent condom use reduces but does not eliminate syphilis transmission risk; regular STI screening for sexually active individuals | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Alcohol cessation as alcohol worsens cognitive impairment and neuropathy, and complicates medication adherence and follow-up | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) discussion for patients at ongoing risk who are HIV-negative | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Fall prevention measures including assistive devices, home safety evaluation, and nightlight use for patients with sensory ataxia (tabes dorsalis), as proprioceptive loss worsens in darkness | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Cognitive rehabilitation strategies including memory aids, structured routines, and supervised medication management for patients with general paresis | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Regular exercise appropriate to functional level for cardiovascular health and prevention of deconditioning | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Smoking cessation to reduce vascular risk (especially important in meningovascular syphilis with stroke risk) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
