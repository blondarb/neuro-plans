## APPENDIX A: FTD Clinical Variants

### Behavioral Variant FTD (bvFTD)

**Core Features (International Consensus Criteria - Rascovsky 2011):**

Early behavioral disinhibition (at least one of):
- Socially inappropriate behavior
- Loss of manners or decorum
- Impulsive, rash, or careless actions

Early apathy or inertia (at least one of):
- Loss of motivation or drive
- Emotional blunting
- Withdrawal from activities

Early loss of sympathy or empathy (at least one of):
- Diminished response to others' needs
- Diminished social interest, warmth
- Personal coldness

Early perseverative, stereotyped, or compulsive/ritualistic behavior (at least one of):
- Simple repetitive movements
- Complex compulsive behaviors
- Stereotypy of speech

Hyperorality and dietary changes (at least one of):
- Altered food preferences (especially sweets)
- Binge eating or increased consumption
- Oral exploration of inedible objects

Neuropsychological profile:
- Executive deficits
- Relative sparing of episodic memory
- Relative sparing of visuospatial skills

**Possible bvFTD:** 3 of 6 features
**Probable bvFTD:** Possible + functional decline + characteristic imaging
**Definite bvFTD:** Histopathological or pathogenic mutation confirmation

---

### Semantic Variant PPA (svPPA)

**Core Features:**
- Impaired confrontation naming
- Impaired single-word comprehension

**Supportive Features (3 of 4 required):**
- Impaired object knowledge
- Surface dyslexia or dysgraphia
- Spared repetition
- Spared speech production (grammar and motor speech)

**Imaging:** Anterior temporal atrophy (typically left > right)

---

### Nonfluent/Agrammatic Variant PPA (nfvPPA)

**Core Features (at least one):**
- Agrammatism in language production
- Effortful, halting speech with inconsistent speech sound errors (apraxia of speech)

**Supportive Features (2 of 3 required):**
- Impaired comprehension of syntactically complex sentences
- Spared single-word comprehension
- Spared object knowledge

**Imaging:** Left posterior fronto-insular atrophy

## APPENDIX B: Genetic Evaluation Guide

### When to Consider Genetic Testing

**Strongly Consider Testing:**
- Family history of FTD, ALS, or unspecified dementia in first-degree relative
- Age of onset <60 years
- FTD-ALS phenotype
- Known family mutation

**Consider Testing:**
- Any FTD diagnosis (30-50% have genetic component)
- Research participation interest
- Family planning implications for children

### Major FTD Genes

| Gene | Protein | Frequency | Phenotype | Pathology |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **C9orf72** | None (repeat expansion) | 25-40% of familial | bvFTD, ALS, FTD-ALS, psychosis | TDP-43, p62 inclusions |
| **GRN** | Progranulin | 15-25% of familial | bvFTD (asymmetric), PPA, CBS | TDP-43 type A |
| **MAPT** | Tau | 10-20% of familial | bvFTD, parkinsonism, PSP-like | Tau pathology |
| **TARDBP** | TDP-43 | <5% | ALS, FTD-ALS | TDP-43 |
| **VCP** | Valosin-containing protein | <5% | IBM, Paget's, FTD | TDP-43 |
| **FUS** | FUS | <1% | ALS, FTD | FUS inclusions |

### Progranulin Screening

Serum progranulin level can screen for GRN mutations:
- **Normal:** >100 ng/mL (varies by assay)
- **Low:** <100 ng/mL suggests GRN mutation; confirm with gene sequencing

### C9orf72 Interpretation

- **Normal:** <30 hexanucleotide repeats
- **Pathogenic:** >30 repeats (typically hundreds to thousands)
- **Intermediate:** 20-30 repeats (clinical significance unclear)
