**SYNONYMS:** Stiff person syndrome, SPS, stiff-man syndrome, Moersch-Woltman syndrome, stiff-limb syndrome, SLS, progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus, PERM, stiff trunk syndrome, stiff person spectrum disorder, SPSD, anti-GAD stiffness syndrome, autoimmune rigidity syndrome, GAD antibody-associated stiffness, stiff body syndrome

**SCOPE:** Diagnostic workup and management of suspected or confirmed Stiff Person Syndrome and its spectrum disorders (classic SPS, stiff-limb syndrome, PERM) across all care settings. Covers initial evaluation, antibody testing (anti-GAD65, anti-amphiphysin, anti-DPPX, anti-glycine receptor), EMG findings, first-line symptomatic therapy (benzodiazepines, baclofen), immunotherapy (IVIg, rituximab, plasmapheresis), and management of acute exacerbations including status spasticus. For isolated cerebellar ataxia with anti-GAD antibodies or autoimmune epilepsy with anti-GAD antibodies, use respective templates. For tetanus or functional neurological disorder evaluation, use respective templates.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Classic Stiff Person Syndrome:** Progressive rigidity and episodic spasms affecting primarily axial and proximal limb muscles with continuous motor unit activity on EMG and positive anti-GAD65 antibodies (typically >2000 IU/mL)
- **Stiff-Limb Syndrome (SLS):** Variant with rigidity and spasms predominantly affecting one or more limbs, often asymmetric; anti-GAD65 may be positive
- **Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus (PERM):** Most severe variant with brainstem and spinal cord involvement; rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic dysfunction, encephalopathy; associated with anti-glycine receptor (GlyR) antibodies or anti-DPPX antibodies
- **Paraneoplastic SPS:** SPS associated with anti-amphiphysin antibodies; most commonly breast cancer, lung cancer, or thymoma
- **Status Spasticus:** Severe, prolonged, unrelenting spasms with potential for respiratory compromise, rhabdomyolysis, and autonomic instability; neurological emergency

| Lorazepam | IV | Acute spasms; alternative to diazepam if IV diazepam unavailable; status spasticus | 2-4 mg :: IV :: PRN q5-10 min :: 2-4 mg IV push over 2 minutes; may repeat q5-10 min; max 8 mg in first hour; less lipophilic than diazepam (shorter CNS duration) | Respiratory depression without ventilator support; acute narrow-angle glaucoma; severe hepatic insufficiency | Respiratory rate; SpO2; sedation level; BP; airway patency | STAT | STAT | - | STAT |
| Midazolam | IV | Status spasticus requiring continuous infusion; ICU setting | 0.05 mg/kg/hr :: IV :: continuous infusion :: 0.5-1 mg IV bolus, then 0.05-0.2 mg/kg/hr continuous infusion; titrate to spasm control; taper gradually over days once spasms controlled | Respiratory depression (requires mechanical ventilation for continuous infusion); acute narrow-angle glaucoma | Continuous SpO2; respiratory rate; BP; sedation level (RASS); ventilator settings | - | - | - | STAT |
| Propofol | IV | Refractory status spasticus not responding to benzodiazepines; ICU with mechanical ventilation | 20 mcg/kg/min :: IV :: continuous infusion :: 0.5-1 mg/kg IV bolus, then 20-50 mcg/kg/min infusion; titrate to spasm suppression; max 80 mcg/kg/min; avoid >48 hours at high doses | Propofol allergy (egg/soy); propofol infusion syndrome risk >48h; hemodynamic instability | Triglycerides q24h; CK; metabolic panel; lactate; propofol infusion syndrome (fever, rhabdo, metabolic acidosis, cardiac failure); hemodynamics | - | - | - | STAT |

*Note: Benzodiazepines are the cornerstone of acute SPS management. Diazepam is preferred over lorazepam for SPS because of its longer duration, active metabolite (desmethyldiazepam), and greater efficacy for muscle relaxation. SPS patients often require much higher benzodiazepine doses than typical use and develop tolerance more slowly than expected. Status spasticus is a neurological emergency requiring ICU admission, aggressive benzodiazepine dosing, and consideration of propofol/midazolam infusion with mechanical ventilation.*

### 3B. Symptomatic Treatments

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|

*Note: Diazepam is the cornerstone of symptomatic SPS management and should be tried FIRST. SPS patients often tolerate very high benzodiazepine doses (60-100+ mg/day of diazepam) without excessive sedation due to the underlying GABAergic deficit. Abrupt benzodiazepine withdrawal in SPS can trigger life-threatening status spasticus. Baclofen is the most commonly used adjunct. Gabapentin/pregabalin provide additional benefit, especially for pain.*

*Note: Corticosteroids are generally LESS effective in SPS compared to other autoimmune neurological conditions. IVIg is the preferred first-line immunotherapy (Class I evidence). Rituximab is increasingly used as second-line or IVIg-sparing therapy, though evidence is Class III-IV. Immunotherapy aims to reduce antibody-mediated GABAergic inhibition impairment. Most patients require combination of symptomatic therapy (benzodiazepines) PLUS immunotherapy for optimal outcomes. Treatment is typically lifelong as relapse is common on discontinuation.*

### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Return to ED immediately for uncontrolled spasms, difficulty breathing, falls with injury, or inability to walk (may indicate status spasticus requiring ICU care) | Y | Y | Y | - |
| SPS is a chronic, treatable autoimmune condition -- improvement is expected with appropriate therapy but may take weeks to months; this is a lifelong condition requiring ongoing treatment | Y | Y | Y | - |
| Do NOT stop benzodiazepines abruptly as this may trigger life-threatening status spasticus (severe unrelenting spasms, respiratory failure); always taper under physician supervision | Y | Y | Y | - |
| Avoid known triggers for spasms: sudden loud noises, unexpected touch, emotional stress, cold temperatures, sudden movements, and crowded environments | - | Y | Y | - |
| Report signs of infection immediately (fever >100.4F, cough, dysuria, rash) as immunosuppressive therapy (IVIg, rituximab) increases infection risk | - | Y | Y | - |
| Do not drive until cleared by neurology due to risk of sudden spasms, impaired mobility, and medication sedation effects | Y | Y | Y | - |
| Keep a spasm diary tracking frequency, severity, triggers, and medication effects to guide treatment optimization | - | Y | Y | - |
| Monitor blood sugars regularly if diabetic or if starting corticosteroids (steroids significantly elevate blood glucose; SPS has high T1DM comorbidity) | Y | Y | Y | - |
| Avoid live vaccines while on immunosuppressive therapy including rituximab and mycophenolate; inform all physicians and pharmacists of immunosuppression status | - | Y | Y | - |
| Carry medical alert identification (bracelet/card) indicating Stiff Person Syndrome, current medications (especially benzodiazepines and immunotherapy), and emergency contact information | - | Y | Y | - |
| Attend all follow-up appointments -- SPS requires regular monitoring with labs, clinical assessments, and periodic antibody levels | - | Y | Y | - |
| In case of surgery or medical procedure, inform anesthesiologist about SPS (risk of exacerbated spasms with certain anesthetic agents; benzodiazepines must NOT be withheld perioperatively) | - | Y | Y | - |
| Avoid alcohol as it potentiates benzodiazepine sedation and increases fall risk | - | Y | Y | - |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |

| Fall prevention measures at home (remove loose rugs, adequate lighting, grab bars in bathroom, non-slip mats) given rigidity and balance impairment | - | Y | Y | - |
| Stress management techniques (meditation, deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, cognitive behavioral therapy) as emotional stress is a common spasm trigger | - | Y | Y | - |
| Adequate sleep (7-8 hours nightly); maintain regular sleep schedule; benzodiazepine dosing may need evening adjustment for nocturnal spasms | - | Y | Y | - |
| Low-impact exercise program as tolerated (walking, stationary cycling, yoga with modifications) to prevent deconditioning from immobility | - | Y | Y | - |

**All of the following must be present:**
- [ ] Progressive rigidity and stiffness of axial muscles (trunk, abdomen) and proximal limb muscles
- [ ] Superimposed episodic spasms triggered by unexpected stimuli (noise, touch, emotional stress)
- [ ] Continuous motor unit activity on EMG (in agonist and antagonist muscles simultaneously)
- [ ] Absence of other neurological or cognitive signs to explain stiffness (normal brain/spine MRI)
- [ ] Positive serology for anti-GAD65 antibodies (present in ~80%) or other SPS-associated antibodies
- [ ] Response to benzodiazepines (supports diagnosis; not required)

### SPS Spectrum Variants

| Variant | Key Features | Antibodies | Prognosis |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Classic SPS | Axial and proximal limb rigidity; episodic spasms; symmetric; anti-GAD65 positive | Anti-GAD65 (~80%) | Generally favorable with treatment; chronic course |
| Stiff-Limb Syndrome (SLS) | Asymmetric limb rigidity; often one leg affected; may be focal | Anti-GAD65 (variable) | Moderate; may evolve to classic SPS |
| PERM | Brainstem/spinal cord involvement; myoclonus; encephalopathy; autonomic dysfunction; most severe | Anti-GlyR; Anti-DPPX; Anti-GAD65 | Poorest; may be monophasic or relapsing |
| Paraneoplastic SPS | Associated with cancer (breast, lung, thymoma); may be any phenotype | Anti-amphiphysin (~100%); Anti-GAD65 (variable) | Depends on tumor response; may improve with cancer treatment |

### Anti-GAD65 Titer Interpretation

| Titer Range | Clinical Significance |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Negative (<5 IU/mL) | Does not exclude SPS (seronegative variant exists); consider CSF testing |
| Low-moderate (5-2000 IU/mL) | More commonly T1DM, autoimmune thyroiditis, cerebellar ataxia; less specific for SPS |
| High (>2000 IU/mL) | Highly suggestive of SPS spectrum; also seen in anti-GAD cerebellar ataxia and autoimmune epilepsy |
| Very high (>10,000 IU/mL) | Strongly associated with SPS; check for intrathecal synthesis |

### EMG Findings in SPS

- **Continuous motor unit activity (CMUA):** Normal-appearing motor units firing continuously in agonist and antagonist muscles simultaneously at rest
- **Co-contraction pattern:** Simultaneous activation of opposing muscle groups (e.g., paraspinal extensors and rectus abdominis)
- **No voluntary suppression:** CMUA persists despite attempts to relax
- **Abolition with benzodiazepines:** CMUA decreases or resolves with IV diazepam (diagnostic challenge)
- **Normal nerve conduction studies:** NCS typically normal; no neuromyotonic discharges (distinguishes from Isaacs syndrome)
- **No denervation potentials:** No fibrillations or positive sharp waves (distinguishes from motor neuron disease)

### Red Flags Suggesting SPS

- [ ] Progressive axial rigidity with preserved cognition
- [ ] Episodic painful spasms triggered by startle or emotional stress
- [ ] Hyperlordosis of lumbar spine with board-like abdominal muscles
- [ ] Difficulty turning or bending at the waist
- [ ] Falls without obvious cause (rigid legs "like walking on stilts")
- [ ] Comorbid T1DM in patient with unexplained rigidity
- [ ] Task-specific phobias (fear of walking, crossing streets) due to spasm anticipation
- [ ] Normal brain MRI with prominent rigidity

### Status Spasticus Emergency Protocol

1. **Immediate:** Diazepam 10-20 mg IV push; may repeat q5-10 min
2. **If refractory:** Midazolam 0.05-0.2 mg/kg/hr IV continuous infusion (ICU with intubation ready)
3. **If still refractory:** Propofol infusion 20-50 mcg/kg/min (requires intubation)
4. **Concurrent:** IV fluids for rhabdomyolysis prevention; CK monitoring; IVIg or PLEX if not recently administered
5. **Avoid:** Abrupt benzodiazepine withdrawal; triggers (minimize stimulation, dark quiet room)
6. **Monitor:** Continuous SpO2; CK q6h; renal function; electrolytes; temperature

## APPENDIX A: SPS Treatment Algorithm

**Step 1 - Symptomatic Therapy (ALL patients):**
- Diazepam 5 mg TID, titrate to 20-60+ mg/day (first-line)
- Add baclofen 5 mg TID, titrate to 40-80 mg/day (adjunctive)
- Add gabapentin/pregabalin if additional benefit needed

**Step 2 - First-line Immunotherapy (most patients):**
- IVIg 2 g/kg over 5 days, repeat q4-6 weeks (Class I evidence)
- Assess response at 3 months

**Step 3 - Second-line Immunotherapy (IVIg failure or partial response):**
- Add rituximab 1000 mg x 2 (day 0, day 14), repeat q6 months
- OR add mycophenolate/azathioprine as IVIg-sparing

**Step 4 - Refractory Disease:**
- Plasmapheresis for acute flares
- Intrathecal baclofen pump for medication-refractory rigidity
- Cyclophosphamide as last resort

**Step 5 - Paraneoplastic SPS:**
- Aggressive cancer screening and treatment
- Immunotherapy as above
- Tumor treatment may improve neurological symptoms

## APPENDIX B: Anesthetic Considerations in SPS

**Perioperative management is critical in SPS patients:**

| Consideration | Recommendation |
|--------------|---------------|
| Benzodiazepines | Do NOT withhold perioperatively; abrupt withdrawal triggers status spasticus |
| Anesthetic agents | Regional anesthesia preferred when feasible; general anesthesia safe with appropriate monitoring |
| Neuromuscular blockers | Depolarizing agents (succinylcholine) may trigger severe spasms -- AVOID; non-depolarizing agents safe |
| Propofol | Safe and effective; GABAergic mechanism beneficial |
| Opioids | Use cautiously; may exacerbate rigidity in some patients |
| Temperature | Monitor closely; spasm-related hyperthermia possible |
| Positioning | Careful positioning due to fixed rigidity; avoid forced range of motion |
| Postoperative | Resume oral benzodiazepines as soon as possible; IV benzodiazepines if NPO; high risk for spasm exacerbation with pain/stress |
