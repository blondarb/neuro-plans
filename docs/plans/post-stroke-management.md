### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Learn and recognize stroke warning signs (FAST: Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call 911); call 911 immediately if any symptom recurs — do not drive yourself | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Take all medications as prescribed; DO NOT stop antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or statin medications without consulting your neurologist — stopping these medications significantly increases recurrent stroke risk | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Monitor blood pressure at home twice daily (morning and evening) using validated automatic cuff; keep a log and bring to all appointments; target <130/80 | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Do not drive until cleared by your neurologist; stroke can affect vision, reaction time, and judgment; formal driving evaluation may be required | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Participate actively in all prescribed rehabilitation therapies (PT, OT, speech); most recovery occurs in first 3-6 months but improvement can continue for years | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Report new mood changes, persistent sadness, loss of interest, or involuntary crying/laughing to your neurologist — post-stroke depression and pseudobulbar affect are common and treatable | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Maintain a medication list including all prescriptions, doses, and schedule; bring to every medical visit and keep a copy in your wallet | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| If on anticoagulation (apixaban, rivaroxaban, warfarin): report any unusual bleeding (gums, nosebleed, blood in urine/stool, easy bruising); carry anticoagulant alert card | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Smoking cessation is the single most important lifestyle modification; reduces recurrent stroke risk by 50%; offer nicotine replacement, varenicline, or bupropion; referral to cessation program | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Mediterranean-style or DASH diet: rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, olive oil; limit sodium to <2300 mg/day (1500 mg if hypertensive); limit processed foods and red meat | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Regular aerobic exercise: 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (walking, swimming, cycling) 5 days/week; adapted to functional level; reduces stroke recurrence by 20-25% | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Limit alcohol to ≤1 drink/day for women, ≤2 drinks/day for men; heavy alcohol increases hemorrhagic stroke risk; complete abstinence preferred if AF or liver disease | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Weight management: target BMI 18.5-25; waist circumference <40" (men) / <35" (women); even modest weight loss (5-10%) improves vascular risk factors | - | - | ROUTINE |
| Diabetes management: target HbA1c <7% (individualize for elderly); regular glucose monitoring; medication adherence; annual diabetic screening (eyes, feet, kidneys) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Sleep apnea screening (present in 50-70% of stroke patients); STOP-BANG questionnaire; polysomnography if positive; CPAP improves vascular outcomes | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Recurrent ischemic stroke | New focal deficit; DWI-positive on MRI; may be same or different vascular territory; reassess etiology | MRI/DWI (new acute infarct); vascular imaging; cardiac evaluation |
| Hemorrhagic transformation of existing infarct | Headache; worsening deficit; on anticoagulation/antiplatelet; typically occurs days 3-7 post-stroke | CT head (hemorrhage within infarct territory); manage anticoagulation |
| Post-stroke seizure | New seizure (focal or generalized); may mimic stroke (Todd paralysis); typically occurs within first year | EEG; MRI (no new infarct on DWI); seizure semiology |
| Post-stroke depression/apathy | Reduced motivation; flat affect; cognitive slowing; may mimic cognitive decline from vascular dementia | PHQ-9; neuropsychological testing; SSRI trial |
| Vascular cognitive impairment | Progressive cognitive decline; executive dysfunction; gait disturbance; strategic infarct dementia | Neuropsychological testing; MRI (strategic infarcts, white matter disease); exclude Alzheimer overlap |
| Central post-stroke pain | Contralateral burning/stinging pain; allodynia; typically thalamic stroke; onset weeks-months post-stroke | Clinical diagnosis; MRI (thalamic infarct); exclude other pain causes |
| Deconditioning / orthostatic hypotension | Weakness and fatigue from prolonged bed rest; orthostatic symptoms; not focal | Orthostatic vitals; functional assessment; PT evaluation |
| Medication side effects | Cognitive slowing; fatigue; sedation from post-stroke medications; overlap with stroke sequelae | Medication review; trial dose reduction; timing of symptoms |

## APPENDIX B: Timing of Anticoagulation After Ischemic Stroke (for AF)

The "1-3-6-12 day rule" guides DOAC initiation based on infarct size:

| Infarct Size | NIHSS | Start DOAC | Rationale |
|--------------|-------|------------|-----------|
| TIA (no infarct) | 0 | Day 1 | No hemorrhagic transformation risk |
| Small infarct (<1.5 cm) | 1-4 | Day 3 | Low HT risk |
| Moderate infarct (1.5-5 cm) | 5-15 | Day 6 | Moderate HT risk; bridging not recommended |
| Large infarct (>5 cm or >1/3 MCA) | >15 | Day 12 | High HT risk; repeat imaging before starting |

**Notes:**
- Repeat CT/MRI before starting DOAC for large infarcts to exclude hemorrhagic transformation
- These are guidelines, not absolute rules — individualize based on clinical judgment
- Bridging with heparin is generally NOT recommended (HAEST, RAF-NOAC data)
- If high recurrence risk and large infarct, consider aspirin bridge until DOAC timing
