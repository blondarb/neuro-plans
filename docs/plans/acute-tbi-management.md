## Section 4: OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS

### 4A. Referrals

| Referral | Indication | Timing |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Neurosurgery | ALL moderate-severe TBI; any subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, depressed skull fracture; ICP monitoring candidacy; surgical decompression evaluation | STAT |
| Trauma surgery | Polytrauma; concomitant thoracic, abdominal, or orthopedic injuries | STAT |
| Ophthalmology | Orbital fractures; visual changes; fundoscopic exam for papilledema; retinal hemorrhages (non-accidental trauma screening) | URGENT |
| Physical medicine & rehabilitation | Early rehabilitation consultation for moderate-severe TBI; functional prognosis assessment; discharge planning | ROUTINE — within 48-72h of admission |
| Social work | Falls in elderly (home safety evaluation); assault (law enforcement, protective orders); domestic violence screening; substance abuse | ROUTINE — within 24h of admission |

### 4B. Patient / Family Instructions

| Topic | Instructions |
|-------|-------------|
| Mild TBI return precautions | Return to ED immediately for: worsening headache not relieved by acetaminophen, repeated vomiting, increasing confusion or difficulty waking, seizure, unequal pupils, weakness on one side, clear fluid from nose or ears, slurred speech |
| Concussion discharge | Cognitive rest for 24-48 hours (limit screen time, reading, mental exertion); gradual return to activity as tolerated; no driving until symptom-free; follow-up with PCP or neurology in 1-2 weeks |
| Family education (moderate-severe) | Expect behavioral changes (irritability, impulsivity, emotional lability), sleep disturbance, headache, cognitive difficulties (memory, attention); recovery trajectory varies — most improvement in first 6-12 months; family support resources |
| Second impact syndrome prevention | Do NOT return to contact sports or activities with fall risk until completely symptom-free AND cleared by physician; second impact before recovery can cause fatal cerebral edema |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | Target Population |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Fall prevention | Elderly (>65 years) — #1 cause of TBI in this population; home safety evaluation, physical therapy for balance, medication review (anticoagulants, sedatives, antihypertensives), vision correction, assistive devices |
| Helmet use | Cyclists, motorcyclists, contact sports athletes, construction/industrial workers, equestrians |
| Seatbelt use | All motor vehicle occupants; proper child restraint systems |
| Alcohol moderation | Alcohol intoxication is present in 30-50% of TBI mechanisms; counseling on alcohol use; SBIRT screening |

## Section 6: MONITORING PARAMETERS

| Parameter | ED | HOSP | ICU | Frequency | Target/Threshold | Action if Abnormal |
|-----------|-----|------|-----|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) | STAT then q1h | q1-2h | q1h (when not sedated) | q1-2h; more frequently if declining | GCS ≥13 (mild); 9-12 (moderate); ≤8 (severe) | Decline ≥2 points → STAT CT head; reassess airway; notify neurosurgery |
| ICP (intracranial pressure) | - | - | Continuous | Continuous if monitored | <22 mmHg (BTF 4th edition) | >22 → tiered therapy: HOB 30°, sedation, osmotherapy, CSF drainage, hyperventilation (brief), neuromuscular blockade, decompressive craniectomy |
| CPP (cerebral perfusion pressure) | - | - | Continuous | Continuous (MAP - ICP) | 60-70 mmHg | <60 → vasopressors (norepinephrine); >70 → risk of ARDS (avoid excessive augmentation) |
| Pupil exam | STAT then q1h | q2h | q1h | q1-2h | Equal, round, reactive to light | New asymmetry (>1 mm difference) or fixed dilated pupil → STAT CT head; impending herniation protocol; STAT neurosurgery |
| Vital signs (HR, BP, RR, SpO2, Temp) | Continuous | q1-4h | Continuous | Continuous (ICU); q1-4h (floor) | SBP >100-110 (per age); SpO2 >94%; Temp 36-37.5°C; HR 60-100 | Hypotension → fluid resuscitation, vasopressors; fever → aggressive cooling; Cushing triad (HTN, bradycardia, irregular respirations) = herniation |
| Sodium | STAT | q4-6h during osmotherapy | q2-6h during hypertonic saline | q2-6h during active therapy | 135-145 (baseline); 145-155 (during ICP crisis); <160 absolute maximum | >160 → hold hypertonic saline; <135 → risk of cerebral edema; overcorrection → central pontine myelinolysis risk when weaning |
| Serum osmolality | STAT | q4-6h during osmotherapy | q4-6h during osmotherapy | q4-6h | 300-320 during osmotherapy; do NOT exceed 320 | >320 → hold mannitol; risk of renal failure and rebound cerebral edema |
| Blood glucose | STAT | q4-6h | q1-2h if on insulin drip | q1-6h depending on acuity | 140-180 mg/dL | <70 → D50 bolus; >200 → insulin adjustment; both extremes worsen TBI outcomes |
| Coagulation (PT/INR, aPTT) | STAT | q6-12h if coagulopathic | q6h if actively correcting | q6-12h until stable | INR <1.4; aPTT <40 sec | Elevated → reversal agents (see 3D); hold procedures until corrected; reassess for DIC |
| Temperature | Continuous | q4h | Continuous | Continuous (ICU) | 36-37.5°C (normothermia) | >38°C → acetaminophen, cooling blanket, infection workup; fever increases ICP and metabolic demand |
| PaCO2 (if intubated) | STAT on ABG | - | Continuous EtCO2 + q4-6h ABG | Continuous EtCO2; ABG q4-6h | 35-40 mmHg (normocapnia); 30-35 only as temporary ICP rescue | >45 → increase ventilator RR; <30 → risk of cerebral ischemia from excessive vasoconstriction |
| Repeat CT head | At 6-8h | With neuro change | At 6-8h; with neuro change | 6-8h after initial; 24h; 48-72h; with ANY neuro change | No hemorrhage expansion; no new hemorrhage; stable midline shift | Expansion → neurosurgical reassessment; new hemorrhage → coagulopathy workup; increased shift → surgical evaluation |

## Section 8: EVIDENCE & REFERENCES

| Recommendation | Evidence Level | Source |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| ICP threshold <22 mmHg for treatment initiation | Level IIB (BTF) | BTF Guidelines 4th Edition — Carney et al., Neurosurgery, 2017 (PMID 27654000); changed from prior threshold of 20 mmHg based on BEST-TRIP trial data |
| Tranexamic acid (TXA) within 3 hours for mild-moderate TBI with intracranial bleeding | Level I (RCT) | CRASH-3 Trial — The Lancet, 2019 (PMID 31623894); benefit in mild-moderate TBI; no benefit in severe TBI (GCS <9) or >3h from injury |
| Early seizure prophylaxis x 7 days reduces early (but not late) seizures | Level I (RCT) | Temkin et al., NEJM, 1990 (PMID 2405974); phenytoin for 7 days; modern practice substitutes levetiracetam (similar efficacy, better safety profile) |
| Coagulopathy reversal — 4-factor PCC preferred for warfarin-associated ICH | Level IIA (Guideline) | Neurocritical Care Society Guidelines; Frontera et al., 2016; PCC faster than FFP with lower volume and fewer complications |
| CT imaging decision rules for mild TBI | Level I (Prospective validation) | Canadian CT Head Rule — Stiell et al., Lancet, 2001 (PMID 11520714); New Orleans Criteria — Haydel et al., NEJM, 2000 (PMID 10891517) |
| Decompressive craniectomy in severe diffuse TBI | Level I (RCT) | DECRA Trial — Cooper et al., NEJM, 2011 (PMID 21434843); early bifrontal decompressive craniectomy lowered ICP but did not improve functional outcomes; controversial |
| Decompressive craniectomy for refractory ICP elevation | Level I (RCT) | RESCUEicp Trial — Hutchinson et al., NEJM, 2016 (PMID 27623518); secondary decompressive craniectomy reduced mortality but increased disability; shared decision-making critical |
| Mannitol vs hypertonic saline for ICP management | Level IIA (Meta-analysis) | Rickard et al., J Neurosurg, 2014; meta-analysis suggests hypertonic saline may be superior to mannitol for ICP reduction; both remain first-line options |
| Early DVT prophylaxis safety in TBI | Level III (Observational) | Byrne et al., J Trauma Acute Care Surg, 2016; pharmacological DVT prophylaxis within 24-72h is safe when hemorrhage is stable on repeat imaging |
| Ketamine safety in TBI — does NOT raise ICP | Level IIA (Systematic review) | Zeiler et al., J Crit Care, 2014 (PMID 24401558); systematic review demonstrating ketamine does not increase ICP; may be neuroprotective; safe for RSI in TBI |
| CPP target 60-70 mmHg | Level IIB (BTF) | BTF Guidelines 4th Edition — Carney et al., 2017; CPP <60 associated with ischemia; CPP >70 associated with ARDS risk (Robertson 1999) |
| Blood pressure thresholds (SBP >100 or >110 by age) | Level III (BTF) | BTF Guidelines 4th Edition — Carney et al., 2017; single episode of SBP <90 doubles mortality; age-adjusted thresholds from recent analysis |

## NOTES

- Hypotension (SBP <90) is the single most preventable cause of secondary brain injury — even one episode doubles mortality in severe TBI
- ICP threshold changed from 20 to 22 mmHg in BTF 4th edition (2017) based on BEST-TRIP trial
- Ketamine is SAFE in TBI patients — the old teaching that it raises ICP has been disproven; it is actually neuroprotective
- Early seizure prophylaxis (7 days) prevents early seizures but does NOT prevent post-traumatic epilepsy — continuing beyond 7 days is not recommended unless clinical seizure occurs
- Coagulopathy reversal should not delay CT — get CT immediately and reverse simultaneously
- Repeat CT at 6-8 hours is critical — 30% of traumatic hemorrhages expand on repeat imaging
