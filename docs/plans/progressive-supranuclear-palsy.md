**SYNONYMS:** Progressive supranuclear palsy, PSP, Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome, PSP-Richardson syndrome, PSP-RS, Richardson syndrome, supranuclear gaze palsy, supranuclear palsy, atypical parkinsonism, tauopathy, PSP-parkinsonism, PSP-P, PSP-progressive gait freezing, PSP-PGF, PSP-frontal, PSP-F, PSP-corticobasal syndrome, PSP-CBS, PSP-speech/language, PSP-SL, PSP-oculomotor, PSP-OM, PSP-postural instability, PSP-PI, nuclear palsy, vertical gaze palsy, downgaze palsy, 4-repeat tauopathy, subcortical parkinsonism

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis and comprehensive management of progressive supranuclear palsy in adults across ED, hospital, outpatient, and ICU settings. Covers MDS-PSP diagnostic criteria application, imaging workup, symptomatic pharmacotherapy (levodopa trial, symptomatic medications), fall prevention, dysphagia management, supportive care, and palliative care integration. Excludes other atypical parkinsonian syndromes (MSA, CBD, DLB) as primary diagnosis, drug-induced parkinsonism, and pediatric tauopathies.

---

**KEY CLINICAL FEATURES:**

- **Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy** (especially downgaze limitation; upgaze often affected first but less specific)
- **Early postural instability** with unexplained backward falls within first year
- **Axial rigidity > limb rigidity** (neck/trunk stiffness predominates)
- **Symmetric parkinsonism** with poor or absent levodopa response
- **Pseudobulbar affect** (involuntary laughing or crying)
- **Frontal cognitive/behavioral changes** (apathy, disinhibition, executive dysfunction)
- **Dysarthria and dysphagia** (early and progressive)
- **Eyelid abnormalities** (blepharospasm, apraxia of eyelid opening/closing)
- **Axial extension posture** (retrocollis, as opposed to flexed posture of PD)
- **"Rocket sign":** patient rises abruptly without planning and falls backward
- **"Applause sign":** inability to stop clapping after 3 claps (frontal lobe dysfunction)

**MEDIAN SURVIVAL:** 6-9 years from symptom onset (Richardson syndrome); longer for PSP-P and PSP-PGF variants

## NOTES

- PSP is the most common atypical parkinsonian syndrome; prevalence approximately 5-7 per 100,000
- Diagnosis is clinical; no single test confirms PSP during life. Definitive diagnosis requires neuropathology (4-repeat tau, globose tangles)
- The "hummingbird sign" on midsagittal MRI (midbrain atrophy) and "morning glory sign" on axial MRI are supportive but not pathognomonic
- Levodopa trial is essential: titrate to 800-1000 mg/day for at least 1 month before declaring failure; document percent improvement
- PSP-P variant may initially respond to levodopa (up to 30% improvement) and can be misdiagnosed as PD for years
- Falls are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality; early investment in PT and assistive devices is critical
- Weighted walkers are preferred over standard walkers because they resist the backward tendency
- Dysphagia progresses inexorably; aspiration pneumonia is a leading cause of death. Early speech therapy and PEG discussion are essential
- No disease-modifying therapy exists; several tau-targeting agents are in clinical trials (antisense oligonucleotides, tau immunotherapy)
- Pseudobulbar affect is common and undertreated; Nuedexta is FDA-approved for this indication
- Goals of care and palliative care should be introduced early given median survival of 6-9 years
- Avoid dopamine-blocking agents (metoclopramide, haloperidol, typical antipsychotics) which worsen parkinsonism
