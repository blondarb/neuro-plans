**SCOPE:** Systematic evaluation of gait disorders in adults presenting with new or progressive difficulty walking. Covers neurological gait patterns: spastic (UMN), ataxic (cerebellar and sensory), parkinsonian/festinating, neuropathic/steppage, myopathic/waddling, frontal/apraxic (NPH), and functional gait disorders. Includes laboratory, imaging, and electrodiagnostic evaluation to identify etiology. Covers treatment of reversible causes (B12 deficiency, NPH, compressive myelopathy, inflammatory conditions). Excludes orthopedic/mechanical gait disorders as primary diagnosis but includes in differential. Excludes isolated vertigo/dizziness evaluation (see separate plan if available).

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Spastic gait:** Stiff-legged, circumduction pattern; UMN lesion (corticospinal tract) from myelopathy, stroke, MS, or hereditary spastic paraplegia
- **Cerebellar ataxic gait:** Wide-based, irregular, lurching; does NOT improve with visual input; cerebellar lesion (stroke, degeneration, MS, tumor, toxic)
- **Sensory ataxic gait:** Wide-based, stamp-like; WORSENS with eye closure (positive Romberg); dorsal column dysfunction (B12 deficiency, tabes dorsalis, sensory neuropathy)
- **Parkinsonian gait:** Short shuffling steps, decreased arm swing, festination (acceleration), en bloc turning; basal ganglia pathology (PD, parkinsonism syndromes)
- **Frontal gait disorder / gait apraxia:** Magnetic gait (feet "stuck to floor"), wide-based, short steps, difficulty initiating; normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), frontal lobe lesions, vascular parkinsonism
- **Steppage gait:** High-stepping to clear foot drop; peripheral neuropathy (CMT, peroneal neuropathy) or L5 radiculopathy
- **Myopathic (waddling) gait:** Lateral trunk sway, Trendelenburg sign; proximal hip girdle weakness (myopathy, muscular dystrophy)
- **Functional gait disorder:** Inconsistent gait pattern; distractibility; Hoover sign; does not conform to known neurological pattern

## NOTES

- Gait disorders are among the most common neurological presentations — systematic pattern recognition (spastic, ataxic, parkinsonian, neuropathic, myopathic, frontal, functional) guides efficient evaluation
- Always consider TREATABLE causes first: B12 deficiency, NPH, cord compression, Wernicke encephalopathy, gluten ataxia, Wilson disease, neurosyphilis
- Wernicke encephalopathy: TREAT EMPIRICALLY with IV thiamine before glucose if any suspicion — classic triad (ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, confusion) present in only ~16% of cases
- NPH is underdiagnosed — consider in any elderly patient with progressive gait disorder + ventriculomegaly on imaging; gait improvement after large-volume LP (30-50 mL) is the best predictor of shunt response
- Elderly gait disorders are often MULTIFACTORIAL — cervical myelopathy + peripheral neuropathy + medication effects + orthostatic hypotension may all coexist; address all contributing factors
- Medication review is one of the highest-yield interventions: benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, sedating medications, and polypharmacy are major modifiable fall risk factors
- Functional gait disorder is a positive diagnosis made by characteristic clinical signs (inconsistency, distractibility, entrainment, Hoover sign) — NOT a diagnosis of exclusion
- Neurosyphilis (tabes dorsalis): IV penicillin G is given inpatient, but OUTPATIENT follow-up is essential — serial CSF VDRL and cell count every 6 months until normalized; repeat LP if CSF not improved at 6 months; serum RPR should decline 4-fold by 12 months
- Physical therapy is beneficial for virtually ALL neurological gait disorders — refer early regardless of etiology
- Fall risk has a cascade effect: fear of falling → activity restriction → deconditioning → increased fall risk; early intervention with PT and assistive devices breaks this cycle
