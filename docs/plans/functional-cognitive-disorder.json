Differentiation from neurodegenerative dementias (Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and other organic causes of cognitive decline. Cognitive behavioral approaches, psychoeducation, and management of perpetuating comorbidities (depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, chronic pain). Complements existing FND and Dementia Evaluation plans. For broader FND management, see \"Functional Neurological Disorder\" template.
