# Acute Myelopathy Evaluation

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 27, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Acute Myelopathy Evaluation

**ICD-10:** G95.9 (Disease of spinal cord, unspecified), G95.89 (Other specified diseases of spinal cord), G37.3 (Acute transverse myelitis in demyelinating disease), G04.91 (Myelitis, unspecified)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC with differential), 80053 (CMP (BMP + LFTs)), 85652 (ESR), 86140 (CRP), 87040 (Blood cultures x2), 82947 (Blood glucose), 81003 (Urinalysis), 86900 (Type and screen), 84145 (Procalcitonin), 86255 (AQP4-IgG (aquaporin-4 antibody, serum) — cell-based assay), 82607 (B12, methylmalonic acid), 82390 (Copper and ceruloplasmin), 87389 (HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody), 86592 (RPR/VDRL), 86235 (Anti-SSA (Ro), anti-SSB (La)), 82164 (ACE level (serum)), 86334 (Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)), 70553 (MRI brain with and without contrast), 71046 (Chest X-ray), 78816 (PET-CT (whole body)), 95925 (Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs)), 62270 (LUMBAR PUNCTURE), 89051 (Cell count with differential (tubes 1 and 4)), 84157 (Protein), 82945 (Glucose with paired serum), 83916 (Oligoclonal bands (paired with serum)), 86327 (IgG index), 88104 (Cytology), 96365 (IV methylprednisolone (empiric — inflammatory myelitis)), 36514 (Plasma exchange (PLEX))

**SYNONYMS:** Acute myelopathy, transverse myelitis, TM, spinal cord inflammation, myelitis, NMOSD myelitis, spinal cord lesion, spinal cord syndrome, cord compression, spinal cord injury

**SCOPE:** Acute or subacute spinal cord dysfunction — broad differential approach. Covers urgent MRI, LP, and comprehensive workup to differentiate compressive (epidural abscess, tumor, disc herniation, hematoma) from non-compressive causes (inflammatory/demyelinating, vascular, infectious). Compressive myelopathy is a surgical emergency. Excludes chronic cervical spondylotic myelopathy, cauda equina syndrome (separate template), and isolated radiculopathy.

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Epidural abscess | Back pain + fever + neurologic deficit (triad in 10-15%); IVDU, diabetes, spinal procedure risk factors; ESR/CRP very elevated | MRI with contrast (ring-enhancing epidural collection); blood cultures; ESR >20 |
| Metastatic cord compression | Known malignancy; progressive back pain (often worse at night); bony destruction | MRI (enhancing epidural mass with bony changes); CT body for primary; PET-CT |
| Disc herniation (acute) | Sudden onset; radiculopathy predominant initially; may progress to myelopathy | MRI (disc protrusion with cord compression) |
| Epidural hematoma | Anticoagulation; post-procedure; coagulopathy; sudden onset | MRI (epidural collection; T1 signal depends on age of blood); coagulation panel |
| Transverse myelitis (idiopathic) | Non-compressive; T2 cord signal change; may be partial or complete; often thoracic | MRI (T2 hyperintensity <3 segments); LP (pleocytosis); diagnose after excluding MS, NMOSD, MOGAD |
| MS (spinal cord relapse) | Partial myelitis (<3 segments); brain lesions present; prior episodes; young adult | MRI brain (periventricular/juxtacortical lesions); oligoclonal bands; short segment cord lesion |
| NMOSD | Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM ≥3 segments); severe; often central cord/gray matter | AQP4-IgG antibody; MRI (LETM, central cord pattern); brain MRI (area postrema lesion) |
| MOGAD | LETM possible; conus/lower cord predilection; may have bilateral optic neuritis | MOG-IgG antibody; MRI pattern; generally better recovery than NMOSD |
| Spinal cord infarction | Hyperacute onset (minutes); anterior spinal artery syndrome (motor + pain/temperature loss, preserved proprioception/vibration); often thoracolumbar | MRI DWI (restricted diffusion, "owl eye" or pencil-like on axial); CTA aorta; vascular risk factors |

| MRI response | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | At 2-4 weeks; 3-6 months; or sooner if worsening | Improving signal and enhancement | Adjust treatment; consider PLEX/escalation |
| AQP4/MOG antibody titers (if positive) | - | - | ROUTINE | - | At 3-6 months, then annually | Declining or stable | If rising with clinical worsening: relapse; adjust DMT |

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Disposition | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Discharge home | Mild myelopathy; stable or improving; ambulatory; independent bladder function; adequate outpatient follow-up; MRI and workup complete or schedulable outpatient |
| Admit to floor | Non-compressive myelopathy requiring IV steroids; moderate deficits; bladder dysfunction requiring catheterization; incomplete workup |
| Admit to ICU | Cervical myelopathy with respiratory compromise; post-surgical; ascending myelopathy; autonomic instability |
| Emergent surgery | Compressive myelopathy: epidural abscess, acute cord compression from tumor/hematoma/disc with neurologic deficit |
| Transfer to higher level | Need for neurosurgery not available; need for PLEX; MRI not available STAT; spinal cord injury center |
| Inpatient rehabilitation (SCI rehab) | Significant motor deficits; paraparesis/paraplegia; wheelchair-dependent; bladder/bowel dysfunction; able to participate in 3h/day therapy |
| Skilled nursing facility | Unable to tolerate intensive rehab; requires skilled nursing; ongoing IV antibiotics |
