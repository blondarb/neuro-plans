# Multiple Sclerosis - New Diagnosis

**VERSION:** 2.2  
**CREATED:** January 13, 2026  
**REVISED:** January 13, 2026  
**STATUS:** Revised per physician feedback

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Multiple Sclerosis - New Diagnosis

**ICD-10:** G35 (Multiple sclerosis)

**SYNONYMS:** Multiple sclerosis, MS, new onset MS, first demyelinating event, clinically isolated syndrome, CIS, demyelinating disease, CNS demyelination, disseminated sclerosis, relapsing-remitting MS, RRMS, SPMS, PPMS

**SCOPE:** Initial diagnostic workup and management of suspected or newly confirmed MS. Covers diagnostic criteria evaluation, mimics exclusion, acute symptom treatment, and DMT initiation framework. For established MS with acute relapse, use "MS - Exacerbation" template. For ongoing DMT management and monitoring, use "MS - Maintenance" template.
