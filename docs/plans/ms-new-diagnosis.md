**CREATED:** January 13, 2026
**REVISED:** January 20, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Multiple Sclerosis - New Diagnosis

**SYNONYMS:** MS, multiple sclerosis, demyelinating disease, RRMS, PPMS, SPMS, CIS

**SCOPE:** Initial diagnostic workup and management of suspected or newly confirmed MS. Covers diagnostic criteria evaluation, mimics exclusion, acute symptom treatment, and DMT initiation framework. For established MS with acute relapse, use "MS - Exacerbation" template. For ongoing DMT management and monitoring, use "MS - Maintenance" template.

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Smoking cessation (smoking accelerates MS progression and disability) | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| Vitamin D supplementation 2000-5000 IU daily (target serum 25-OH vitamin D >40 ng/mL) | - | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| Regular aerobic exercise 150 min/week as tolerated (improves fatigue, mood, function) | - | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| Resistance training 2-3Ã—/week | - | - | âœ“ |
| Stress management and adequate sleep (7-8 hours nightly) | - | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| Avoid excessive heat exposure (hot tubs, saunas, prolonged direct sun, exercising in heat) | - | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| Cooling vest for outdoor activities in warm weather | - | - | âœ“ |
| Maintain healthy weight (obesity associated with worse outcomes) | - | - | âœ“ |
| Limit alcohol intake (can worsen balance, cognition, bladder symptoms) | - | - | âœ“ |
| Ensure vaccinations up to date before DMT initiation (live vaccines contraindicated on many DMTs) | - | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| Fall prevention: remove loose rugs, ensure adequate lighting, use assistive devices if needed | - | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| Energy conservation techniques for fatigue management (pacing, prioritization, positioning) | - | âœ“ | âœ“ |

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Disposition | Criteria |
