# Wernicke Encephalopathy

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 29, 2026
**REVISED:** January 29, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Wernicke Encephalopathy

**ICD-10:** E51.2 (Wernicke encephalopathy), E51.11 (Dry beriberi), F10.96 (Alcohol use, unspecified with alcohol-induced persisting amnestic disorder)

**CPT CODES:** 82962 (Fingerstick glucose), 80048 (BMP), 83735 (Magnesium), 84100 (Phosphorus), 85025 (CBC), 80076 (LFTs, albumin), 82140 (Ammonia), 83605 (Lactate), 80320 (Blood alcohol level), 84425 (Thiamine level (whole blood or RBC transketolase)), 84443 (TSH), 80307 (Urine drug screen), 85610 (Coagulation studies (PT/INR)), 70551 (MRI brain with FLAIR/DWI), 70450 (CT head), 95816 (EEG), 62270 (Lumbar puncture), 96374 (Thiamine IV (high-dose) - Suspected/Confirmed WE)

**SYNONYMS:** Wernicke encephalopathy, WE, Wernicke syndrome, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, WKS, thiamine deficiency encephalopathy, Wernicke-Korsakoff, acute thiamine deficiency, alcohol-related brain damage, nutritional encephalopathy

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis and treatment of Wernicke encephalopathy in adults including classic and non-alcoholic etiologies. Covers acute treatment, prevention of Korsakoff syndrome, and at-risk populations. Applies primarily to ED, hospital, and ICU settings as this is a medical emergency. Excludes chronic Korsakoff syndrome management.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Wernicke Encephalopathy (WE):** Acute neuropsychiatric syndrome from thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency; classically presents with triad of encephalopathy, oculomotor dysfunction, and ataxia
- **Korsakoff Syndrome:** Chronic amnestic syndrome (anterograde > retrograde amnesia, confabulation) following untreated or inadequately treated WE
- **Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome (WKS):** Combined acute WE with subsequent Korsakoff syndrome
- **Classic Triad:** Mental status changes, oculomotor dysfunction, gait ataxia (only ~10-16% present with all three)
- **At-Risk Populations:** Alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, hyperemesis gravidarum, bariatric surgery, chronic illness, prolonged fasting, refeeding, dialysis, cancer, AIDS

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Discharge criteria | Mental status normalized; tolerating oral thiamine; safe discharge plan |
| Neurology follow-up | 2-4 weeks post-discharge; assess for persistent deficits |
| Addiction medicine follow-up | If alcohol use disorder; outpatient treatment program |
| Urgent readmission | Recurrent symptoms; inability to take oral thiamine; relapse |

## 8. EVIDENCE & REFERENCES

| Recommendation | Evidence Level | Source |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| High-dose IV thiamine (500 mg TID) for suspected WE | Class II, Level B | [EFNS guidelines](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20642790/); Cochrane review (limited RCT data but expert consensus) |
| Thiamine before glucose in at-risk patients | Class I (practice standard) | Physiologic rationale; case reports of precipitation |
| MRI typical findings in WE | Class II, Level B | Multiple case series; imaging studies |
| Magnesium replacement essential | Class II, Level B | Cofactor for thiamine-dependent enzymes |
| Oral thiamine poorly absorbed in alcoholics | Class II | Pharmacokinetic studies; supports IV administration |
| Prophylactic thiamine in at-risk populations | Class II, Level B | Observational data; prevention superior to treatment |
| Classic triad present in minority | Class II | Autopsy studies show only 10-16% have all three features |

---

## CLINICAL FEATURES

**Classic Triad (present in only 10-16%):**
1. **Encephalopathy:** Confusion, disorientation, apathy, inattention, obtundation, coma
2. **Oculomotor dysfunction:** Nystagmus (horizontal > vertical), lateral rectus palsy (CN VI), conjugate gaze palsy
3. **Gait ataxia:** Wide-based, unsteady; may be unable to walk

**Other Features:**
- Hypothermia
- Hypotension
- Tachycardia
- Peripheral neuropathy (feet > hands)
- Vestibular dysfunction without hearing loss

**Caine Criteria (2 of 4 for diagnosis in alcoholics):**
1. Dietary deficiency
2. Oculomotor abnormalities
3. Cerebellar dysfunction
4. Either altered mental status or mild memory impairment

---

## NOTES

- Wernicke encephalopathy is a MEDICAL EMERGENCY - treatment should not be delayed for diagnostic confirmation
- Classic triad is present in only 10-16% of cases; have low threshold to treat empirically
- ALWAYS give thiamine BEFORE or SIMULTANEOUSLY with glucose/dextrose in at-risk patients
- Oral thiamine is poorly absorbed in alcoholics; IV route is essential for acute treatment
- Magnesium is a required cofactor; replace aggressively
- High-dose IV thiamine (500 mg TID) is recommended; standard doses (100 mg) are inadequate for acute WE
- MRI may be normal in early WE; clinical diagnosis takes precedence
- Without treatment, mortality is ~20% and ~80% develop Korsakoff syndrome
- Korsakoff syndrome (chronic amnestic state) is largely irreversible once established
- Oculomotor abnormalities respond quickly (hours to days); ataxia and encephalopathy take longer
- Non-alcoholic WE (hyperemesis, bariatric surgery, malnutrition) may have atypical presentations
- Thiamine is safe; there is no downside to empiric treatment
