# Rapidly Progressive Dementia

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 27, 2026
**STATUS:** Approved

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Rapidly Progressive Dementia (RPD)

**ICD-10:** F03.90 (Unspecified dementia without behavioral disturbance), G31.9 (Degenerative disease of nervous system, unspecified), A81.00 (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, unspecified), G30.9 (Alzheimer's disease, unspecified), G31.09 (Other frontotemporal dementia)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC with differential), 80053 (CMP), 84443 (TSH), 82607 (B12), 82746 (Folate), 85652 (ESR), 86140 (CRP), 86592 (RPR or VDRL), 87389 (HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody), 81003 (Urinalysis), 82947 (Blood glucose), 86235 (ANA), 86334 (Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)), 84425 (Thiamine (B1) level), 82390 (Copper), 84630 (Zinc level), 82533 (Cortisol), 83655 (Heavy metals: lead), 83519 (14-3-3 protein (CSF)), 70553 (MRI brain with and without contrast), 95816 (EEG), 70450 (CT head without contrast), 72141 (MRI spine), 95700 (Continuous EEG (cEEG)), 78608 (FDG-PET brain), 78816 (PET-CT body), 89051 (Cell count with differential), 84157 (Protein), 82945 (Glucose with paired serum), 83916 (Oligoclonal bands), 96374 (Thiamine (B1) IV), 96365 (IV methylprednisolone)

**SYNONYMS:** Rapidly progressive dementia, RPD, rapidly progressive cognitive decline, subacute dementia, prion disease evaluation, CJD workup, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, rapid onset dementia, fast progressing dementia, subacute encephalopathy, prion disease, fast dementia

**SCOPE:** Urgent evaluation of cognitive decline progressing over weeks to months (typically <1-2 years from symptom onset to severe disability). Covers comprehensive workup to identify treatable causes including autoimmune encephalitis, infectious etiologies, toxic-metabolic causes, CNS malignancy, and prion disease (CJD). The key principle: assume a treatable cause exists until proven otherwise. Excludes typical slowly progressive dementias (Alzheimer's, FTD) unless presenting atypically fast, and acute delirium (<days).

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) | Weeks-months; myoclonus; startle; akinetic mutism late; MRI cortical ribboning + caudate/putamen DWI signal; PSWCs on EEG | RT-QuIC (CSF); 14-3-3; total tau >1150; MRI DWI; EEG |
| Autoimmune encephalitis (anti-NMDAR) | Subacute; psychiatric symptoms → seizures → movement disorder → autonomic → decreased consciousness; young women; ovarian teratoma | NMDAR antibody (CSF > serum); pelvic imaging |
| Autoimmune encephalitis (anti-LGI1) | Faciobrachial dystonic seizures; hyponatremia; memory loss; >40 years | LGI1 antibody (serum > CSF); serum Na |
| Hashimoto encephalopathy (SREAT) | Euthyroid or hypothyroid; high anti-TPO; steroid-responsive; diagnosis of exclusion | Anti-TPO elevated; response to steroids; exclude other causes |
| Rapidly progressive Alzheimer disease (rpAD) | Most common misdiagnosis of CJD; positive AD biomarkers (low Aβ42, high p-tau); no myoclonus typically; MRI shows atrophy, no DWI ribboning | CSF AD biomarkers (Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio low, p-tau elevated); MRI (atrophy without DWI cortical signal); RT-QuIC negative |
| CNS lymphoma (primary or intravascular) | B symptoms; enhancing mass (primary); multifocal white matter changes with LDH elevation and no mass (intravascular) | MRI with contrast; CSF cytology + flow cytometry; EBV PCR; brain biopsy; LDH; peripheral smear |
| Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis | Known malignancy; cranial neuropathies; communicating hydrocephalus; CSF cytology positive | CSF cytology (repeat x3); MRI with contrast (leptomeningeal enhancement) |
| Neurosyphilis | RPR/VDRL positive; Argyll Robertson pupils; psychiatric symptoms; may have prior STI history | RPR/VDRL (serum); CSF VDRL; FTA-ABS |
| Wernicke encephalopathy | Acute confusion + ophthalmoplegia + ataxia triad (only 10% have all three); alcoholism, malnutrition | Thiamine level (draw before treatment); MRI (mamillary body, thalamic signal); clinical response to thiamine |
| CNS vasculitis | Headache; multifocal deficits; strokes; CSF pleocytosis | MRA (beading); DSA; brain/meningeal biopsy; ESR/CRP elevated |
| Neurosarcoidosis | Cranial neuropathies (CN VII); leptomeningeal enhancement; hilar adenopathy; elevated ACE | Chest CT; serum/CSF ACE; biopsy (granulomas) |
| Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) | Triad: gait disorder (predominant) + urinary incontinence + dementia; "wet, wobbly, and wacky"; ventricular enlargement disproportionate to atrophy | Large-volume LP (30-50 mL) with pre/post gait assessment; MRI (Evans index >0.3) |
| Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy | Medication toxicity (lithium, methotrexate, chemotherapy); substance abuse; hepatic/uremic encephalopathy | Drug levels; LFTs; ammonia; BUN/Cr; UDS |
| Depression/Pseudo-dementia | Depressive symptoms predominant; subjective cognitive complaints > objective deficits; onset correlates with depressive episode | Neuropsychological testing; psychiatric evaluation; may improve with antidepressant |
| Whipple disease | Oculomasticatory myorhythmia (pathognomonic); GI symptoms; arthralgia; chronic diarrhea | T. whipplei PCR (CSF, duodenal biopsy); PAS-positive macrophages on biopsy |
| PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) | Immunocompromised; multifocal white matter lesions (no enhancement typically); progressive deficits | JC virus PCR (CSF); MRI pattern; clinical context |
| Fatal familial insomnia | Genetic prion disease; progressive insomnia → autonomic dysfunction → motor signs → dementia; family history | PRNP gene testing (D178N mutation with 129M); polysomnography (absent sleep spindles) |

## 6. MONITORING PARAMETERS

| Swallowing assessment | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | Weekly; SLP evaluation | Safe oral intake | Modified diet; NG/PEG if progressive |
| Weight | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Weekly | Stable | Nutritional support |
| Serum sodium | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | q12-24h initially; then per clinical indication | 135-145 mEq/L | SIADH management if low; LGI1 encephalitis associated with hyponatremia |
| Renal function | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Daily if on acyclovir or nephrotoxic drugs; weekly otherwise | Stable | Dose adjustments |
| Response to immunotherapy | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Assess at day 5 of steroids/IVIG; then weekly | Objective improvement in cognition or exam | If no response: consider second-line (rituximab); reconsider diagnosis |
| Autoimmune antibody titers (follow-up) | - | - | ROUTINE | - | q3-6 months if positive | Declining titers | If rising: relapse risk; adjust immunotherapy |
| Safety assessment (fall risk, wandering, capacity) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Daily inpatient; each visit outpatient | Safe | Increase supervision; facility placement if needed |
