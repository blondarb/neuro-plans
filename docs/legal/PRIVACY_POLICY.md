# Neuro Plans — Privacy Policy

*Last updated: February 12, 2026*

Steven Arbogast ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Neuro Plans mobile application (the "App").

## Overview

Neuro Plans is a clinical reference tool. We do not require account creation, do not use third-party analytics or advertising services, and all clinical data is bundled within the App for offline use.

## Information We Collect

**Email Address (Optional).** If you verify your email for team access, it is stored locally on your device to check domain eligibility. It is not sent to us or any third party.

**Clinical Error Reports (Optional).** If you submit a clinical error report, the report content (plan name, section, error description, severity, and any suggested correction) is stored locally on your device. You may choose to send the report to errors@neuroplans.app via your device's mail app. Reports do not contain personal information unless you voluntarily include it.

## Information Stored on Your Device

The App stores preferences locally using iOS UserDefaults, including favorites, recent plans, display settings, email (if entered), error reports, and disclaimer acceptance. This data never leaves your device unless you choose to email an error report. Uninstalling the App deletes all locally stored data.

## Subscriptions and Payments

Subscriptions are managed entirely by Apple through StoreKit. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information. See [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/).

## App Store Analytics

We may review aggregated, anonymous analytics provided by Apple through App Store Connect (downloads, sessions, crashes). We cannot identify individual users from this data. You can opt out in iOS Settings under Privacy & Security → Analytics & Improvements.

## Third-Party Services

None. The App does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking.

## Children's Privacy

The App is a professional clinical reference tool. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

## Changes

We may update this policy and will post changes at https://neuroplans.app/privacy.
