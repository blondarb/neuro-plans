## How Plans Are Created

1. **Request** - Submit a plan request via GitHub Issues
2. **Build** - AI-assisted draft generation using the [Builder Skill](skills/neuro-builder-skill.md)
3. **Validate** - Quality scoring using the [Checker Skill](skills/neuro-checker-skill.md)
4. **Review** - Physician review and approval
5. **Publish** - Validated plans added to the library

All plans target **90%+ validation score** across six domains: completeness, accuracy, safety, objectivity, setting appropriateness, and usability.
