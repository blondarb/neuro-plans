# Delirium versus Dementia — Diagnostic Evaluation

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** February 9, 2026
**REVISED:** February 9, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft — Awaiting physician review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Delirium versus Dementia — Diagnostic Evaluation

**ICD-10:** R41.0 (Disorientation, unspecified), F05 (Delirium due to known physiological condition), R41.3 (Other amnesia), F03.90 (Unspecified dementia without behavioral disturbance), R41.82 (Altered mental status, unspecified), F01.50 (Vascular dementia without behavioral disturbance), G30.9 (Alzheimer disease, unspecified)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC), 80048 (BMP), 80053 (CMP), 84443 (TSH), 82607 (Vitamin B12), 82728 (Ferritin), 82947 (Glucose), 81001 (Urinalysis with microscopy), 87086 (Urine culture), 71046 (Chest X-ray, 2 views), 70553 (MRI brain with/without contrast), 70551 (MRI brain without contrast), 70450 (CT head without contrast), 89050 (CSF cell count), 89051 (CSF differential), 89321 (CSF protein), 89322 (CSF glucose), 95816 (EEG), 96116 (Neuropsychological testing), 82575 (Drug screen), 82785 (Ammonia)

**SYNONYMS:** Acute confusion, acute confusional state, altered mental status, encephalopathy, acute encephalopathy, delirium vs dementia workup, cognitive decline evaluation, acute-on-chronic confusion, sundowning evaluation, hospital delirium, ICU delirium, postoperative delirium, toxic-metabolic encephalopathy

**SCOPE:** Systematic evaluation to differentiate delirium from dementia and identify reversible causes of acute confusion. Covers ED evaluation of altered mental status, inpatient delirium prevention and management, outpatient evaluation of cognitive complaints with possible delirium superimposed on dementia. Excludes detailed management of specific dementia subtypes (see Alzheimer's, Vascular Dementia, and other dementia-specific templates). Focuses on the diagnostic differentiation and acute management.

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Delirium:** Acute disturbance in attention and awareness developing over hours to days, with additional cognitive disturbance (disorientation, memory, language, visuospatial, perception), that is not better explained by a pre-existing neurocognitive disorder and is caused by a medical condition, substance, or toxin
- **Hyperactive delirium:** Agitation, restlessness, hallucinations, pulling at lines/tubes; easily recognized
- **Hypoactive delirium:** Lethargy, reduced alertness, diminished responsiveness, psychomotor retardation; frequently missed, worse prognosis
- **Mixed delirium:** Fluctuating between hyperactive and hypoactive states within the same episode
- **Dementia (Major Neurocognitive Disorder):** Acquired, progressive decline in cognitive function (memory, executive function, language, visuospatial, social cognition) severe enough to interfere with independence in daily activities; insidious onset over months to years
- **Delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD):** Acute confusional state occurring in a patient with pre-existing dementia; very common (up to 65% of hospitalized dementia patients); worse outcomes than either alone
- **CAM (Confusion Assessment Method):** Validated delirium screening tool requiring: (1) acute onset/fluctuating course AND (2) inattention AND either (3) disorganized thinking OR (4) altered level of consciousness

## KEY DIFFERENTIATING FEATURES

| Feature | Delirium | Dementia |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Onset** | Acute (hours to days) | Insidious (months to years) |
| **Course** | Fluctuating; worse at night | Progressive, relatively stable day-to-day |
| **Duration** | Days to weeks (reversible) | Chronic, progressive (months-years) |
| **Attention** | Impaired early and prominently | Preserved until late stages |
| **Consciousness** | Altered (hyperalert or drowsy) | Clear until late stages |
| **Hallucinations** | Common (visual > auditory) | Late finding in most dementias (early in LBD) |
| **Psychomotor** | Hyper or hypoactive | Usually normal until moderate-severe stage |
| **Reversibility** | Usually reversible if cause treated | Generally irreversible (except reversible causes) |
| **EEG** | Diffuse slowing | Normal or mild slowing |

## 4. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS

### 4A. Referrals & Consults

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Neurology consultation for atypical delirium (young patient, no identifiable cause, focal signs, rapidly progressive), suspected autoimmune encephalitis, or NCSE evaluation | URGENT | URGENT | ROUTINE | URGENT |
| Geriatrics or hospital medicine for delirium prevention program implementation (HELP program — Hospital Elder Life Program) and complex geriatric care | - | ROUTINE | - | - |
| Neurology/neuropsychology for outpatient dementia evaluation after delirium resolves: formal cognitive testing, dementia subtype characterization, and treatment planning | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Psychiatry for behavioral management if severe agitation not responding to low-dose antipsychotics, or concurrent major psychiatric disorder complicating delirium management | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | URGENT |
| Social work and case management for discharge planning, caregiver support, safety assessment, and community resources for patients with newly identified dementia | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Palliative care if advanced dementia with delirium; goals of care discussion; comfort-focused management | - | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE |

### 4B. Patient/Family Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Delirium is a medical emergency indicating an underlying medical problem — it is not "normal aging" or "just confusion" and requires thorough medical evaluation | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Family members are the most valuable resource for detecting delirium: inform the medical team if your loved one is "not themselves," more confused than usual, seeing things, or unusually agitated or withdrawn | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Bring glasses, hearing aids, and familiar objects from home to the hospital — sensory deprivation and unfamiliar environments worsen delirium | - | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE |
| Stay with the patient during hospitalization if possible — familiar faces and voices provide reorientation and reduce agitation more effectively than medications | - | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE |
| Do not use physical restraints unless absolutely necessary for immediate safety — restraints increase delirium severity, duration, and risk of injury | - | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE |
| After discharge, a new dementia evaluation may be recommended — delirium can unmask underlying cognitive decline that was not previously recognized | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Report any worsening confusion, fever, falls, or inability to take medications after discharge — delirium can recur, and underlying causes may not fully resolve at discharge | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4C. Delirium Prevention (HELP Program Components)

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Implement Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) protocols: orienting communication, early mobilization, sleep protocol, hydration assistance, vision/hearing optimization, and cognitive stimulation | - | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE |
| Avoid prescribing high-risk medications in elderly patients: benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, opioids (minimize), sedative-hypnotics (no zolpidem, no diphenhydramine for sleep) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Minimize urinary catheter use (remove within 24h if possible); each day with a catheter increases delirium and infection risk | - | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE |
| Target light sedation (RASS 0 to -1) in ICU; daily sedation interruption; avoid benzodiazepine-based sedation protocols (prefer dexmedetomidine or propofol) | - | - | - | ROUTINE |
| Ensure adequate pain management — undertreated pain precipitates delirium; use scheduled acetaminophen (not PRN); minimize opioids; use multimodal analgesia | - | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE |

## NOTES

- Delirium is a medical emergency — it carries 10-26% mortality in hospitalized elderly and indicates an underlying medical condition that must be identified and treated
- Hypoactive delirium is missed in up to 70% of cases — always screen with CAM; a "quiet" confused patient is delirious, not just "tired"
- The most common precipitants of delirium in elderly: infection (UTI, pneumonia), medications (anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, opioids), metabolic (Na, glucose, renal failure), dehydration, pain, urinary retention, fecal impaction, sleep deprivation
- Medications are the single most modifiable risk factor — calculate ACB score on every confused elderly patient
- DO NOT anchor on UTI: asymptomatic bacteriuria is present in 25-50% of elderly and does NOT cause delirium unless there is a symptomatic infection; treat the patient, not the urine culture
- Delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD) is very common and carries worse outcomes than either condition alone; get collateral history from family about baseline cognitive function
- Always give thiamine BEFORE glucose in confused patients with possible alcohol use or malnutrition — glucose metabolism consumes thiamine and can precipitate Wernicke encephalopathy
- Non-pharmacologic interventions (HELP program) are the evidence-based standard of care; antipsychotics are only for acute safety and do NOT reduce delirium duration
- AVOID haloperidol in suspected Lewy body dementia — severe neuroleptic sensitivity can cause life-threatening parkinsonism; use quetiapine if antipsychotic absolutely needed
- After delirium resolves, arrange cognitive follow-up: 30-40% of patients with delirium will be found to have underlying dementia that was previously unrecognized
- All hospital staff should know: delirium is not dementia, it is not "normal," and it requires urgent medical attention
