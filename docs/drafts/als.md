# Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 27, 2026
**REVISED:** January 27, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) / Motor Neuron Disease

**ICD-10:** G12.21 (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)

**SCOPE:** Comprehensive outpatient-focused management of ALS including diagnostic workup, El Escorial/Awaji criteria application, disease-modifying therapy (riluzole, edaravone, AMX0035), symptomatic management (sialorrhea, spasticity, pseudobulbar affect, pain, dyspnea), respiratory monitoring with BiPAP timing, nutritional support with PEG timing, multidisciplinary clinic model, and palliative care integration. Excludes primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), and pediatric motor neuron disease.

**CLINICAL SYNONYMS:** Lou Gehrig's disease, motor neuron disease (MND), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, classical ALS, bulbar-onset ALS, limb-onset ALS

---

**KEY CLINICAL FEATURES:**
- Progressive combined upper motor neuron (UMN) AND lower motor neuron (LMN) signs
- UMN signs: spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, clonus
- LMN signs: weakness, atrophy, fasciculations, hyporeflexia
- Typically asymmetric onset; spreads contiguously
- **Bulbar-onset (25%):** dysarthria, dysphagia, tongue fasciculations
- **Limb-onset (75%):** focal limb weakness, foot drop, grip weakness
- Cognitive impairment in 35-50%; frontotemporal dementia in 10-15%
- **Preserved:** Eye movements, sphincter function (until late)

**MEDIAN SURVIVAL:** 3-5 years from symptom onset; 2-3 years from diagnosis

---

**EL ESCORIAL DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (Revised):**

| Category | UMN + LMN Signs Required |
|----------|--------------------------|
| **Clinically Definite ALS** | 3 regions (bulbar, cervical, thoracic, lumbosacral) |
| **Clinically Probable ALS** | 2 regions with UMN rostral to LMN |
| **Clinically Probable - Lab Supported** | 1 region with EMG evidence in 2 limbs |
| **Clinically Possible ALS** | 1 region only, or UMN only in 2+ regions |

**AWAJI-SHIMA CRITERIA (2008):** EMG findings of acute denervation and chronic reinnervation are equivalent to clinical LMN signs. Fasciculation potentials with chronic neurogenic changes support diagnosis.

---

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

---

!!! warning "MULTIDISCIPLINARY CARE IS ESSENTIAL"
    ALS patients managed in multidisciplinary clinics have **improved survival (7-10 months)** and better quality of life. Coordinate neurology, pulmonology, nutrition, PT, OT, speech, respiratory therapy, social work, and palliative care.
