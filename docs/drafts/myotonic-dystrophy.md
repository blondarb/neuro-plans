### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Return to ED immediately if palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, or near-syncope (may indicate cardiac arrhythmia or heart block -- leading cause of sudden death in DM1) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE |
| Return to ED if new difficulty breathing, worsening shortness of breath, or morning headaches (may indicate respiratory muscle weakness or hypoventilation requiring ventilatory support) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE |
| Return to ED if fall with head injury, inability to get up, or new severe pain (progressive weakness increases fall risk) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE |
| Return to ED if choking during eating or drinking, inability to swallow medications, or recurrent coughing with meals (aspiration risk from oropharyngeal weakness) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE |
| Return to ED if fever with cough or difficulty breathing (may indicate aspiration pneumonia given dysphagia risk) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Low-to-moderate intensity exercise program (walking, swimming, stationary cycling) 3-5 days per week to maintain cardiovascular fitness and slow deconditioning; avoid extreme exertion which may worsen weakness | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| High-protein diet (1.0-1.5 g/kg/day protein) to support muscle preservation; adequate caloric intake to prevent weight loss from dysphagia or GI dysmotility | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |

| Strict glycemic control (HbA1c <7%) to prevent diabetic complications and neuropathy progression in DM patients with insulin resistance or diabetes | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Alcohol limitation as alcohol worsens respiratory depression, increases fall risk, exacerbates hepatic dysfunction, and interacts with CNS-depressant medications | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Smoking cessation to reduce respiratory infection risk and improve pulmonary function (already compromised by respiratory muscle weakness) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| CPAP/BiPAP compliance essential for patients with sleep-disordered breathing to prevent nocturnal hypoxia, morning headaches, and daytime somnolence | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Adequate sleep hygiene (consistent schedule, 7-9 hours) to manage DM1-related hypersomnia; avoid sedating medications when possible | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |

| Agent | Risk | Alternative |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Succinylcholine** | CONTRAINDICATED -- causes severe, prolonged myotonic contracture unresponsive to neuromuscular blockade reversal; may cause masseter spasm and impossible intubation; hyperkalemia risk | Non-depolarizing agents (rocuronium, vecuronium, cisatracurium) at reduced doses |
| **Volatile anesthetics (halothane, sevoflurane, isoflurane, desflurane)** | Malignant hyperthermia-LIKE reactions (not true MH but clinically similar); prolonged recovery; respiratory depression; cardiac arrhythmia | Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil preferred |
| **Neostigmine (high dose)** | Anticholinesterase reversal agents can precipitate myotonic crisis and profound bradycardia in DM1 | Sugammadex for rocuronium reversal (preferred); minimal neostigmine if absolutely necessary |

### Perioperative Management

| Phase | Key Considerations |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Pre-operative** | ECG and cardiac clearance; PFTs if not recent; anesthesia consult mandatory; discuss ventilatory support plan; document genetic type (DM1 vs DM2 -- DM1 higher risk) |
| **Intra-operative** | Avoid succinylcholine; TIVA preferred; reduced doses of non-depolarizing agents; temperature monitoring; avoid hypothermia (worsens myotonia); cardiac monitoring throughout |
| **Post-operative** | Prolonged PACU monitoring (minimum 24-48 hours for major surgery); delayed extubation is common; respiratory monitoring (pulse oximetry, capnography); avoid opioids or use minimal doses with close monitoring; aspiration precautions |

### Emergency Situations

- If malignant hyperthermia-like reaction: treat per MH protocol (dantrolene 2.5 mg/kg IV, cooling measures) even though not true MH
- If myotonic crisis (sustained myotonic contracture): IV mexiletine if available; warm IV fluids; avoid triggering agents; supportive care
- If cardiac arrest: standard ACLS protocol; be aware that standard antiarrhythmics may be less effective; early pacing for bradycardia

## APPENDIX B: DM1 vs DM2 COMPARISON

| Feature | DM1 (Steinert Disease) | DM2 (PROMM) |
|---------|------------------------|--------------|
| **Genetics** | CTG repeat expansion, DMPK gene, chromosome 19q13.3 | CCTG repeat expansion, CNBP (ZNF9) gene, chromosome 3q21.3 |
| **Inheritance** | Autosomal dominant with anticipation | Autosomal dominant; minimal or no anticipation |
| **Congenital form** | Yes (severe, maternal transmission) | No congenital form |
| **Weakness pattern** | Distal > proximal (grip, ankle dorsiflexion, facial, neck flexors) | Proximal > distal (hip flexors, quadriceps, neck flexors) |
| **Myotonia** | Prominent (grip, percussion, jaw) | Variable; often milder; pain more prominent than stiffness |
| **Cardiac** | Severe conduction disease; arrhythmias; sudden death risk (25-30% of deaths) | Less severe; conduction abnormalities occur but less frequent |
| **Cataracts** | >90%; posterior subcapsular "Christmas tree" | Common; posterior subcapsular but less distinctive |
| **CNS involvement** | Significant: executive dysfunction, apathy, hypersomnia, white matter changes | Milder cognitive involvement |
| **Diabetes/insulin resistance** | 25-75% | Present but less common |
| **GI involvement** | Significant dysmotility, dysphagia, pseudo-obstruction | Milder GI involvement |
| **Respiratory** | Diaphragmatic weakness; central + obstructive sleep apnea; hypoventilation | Less severe respiratory involvement |
| **Severity** | Generally more severe; earlier onset with larger repeats | Generally milder; later onset (mean 40-50 years) |
| **Life expectancy** | Reduced (mean 50-60 years in classic DM1) | Near-normal in many patients |
| **Myalgia** | Less prominent | More prominent (can be presenting symptom) |
