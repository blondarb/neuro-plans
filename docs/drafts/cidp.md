# Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 27, 2026
**REVISED:** January 27, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)

**ICD-10:** G61.81

**SCOPE:** Evaluation, diagnosis, treatment initiation, and long-term management of CIDP in adults. Covers typical CIDP, CIDP variants (MADSAM, DADS, sensory CIDP), first-line immunotherapy (IVIg, corticosteroids, plasmapheresis), second-line immunosuppressants, and subcutaneous immunoglobulin therapy. Primary focus is outpatient management with coverage for acute presentations and hospitalizations. Excludes Guillain-Barré syndrome (acute onset <8 weeks), hereditary neuropathies (CMT), and pediatric CIDP.

**CLINICAL SYNONYMS:** Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, chronic relapsing polyneuropathy, chronic acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy, CIDP

**ADDITIONAL ICD-10 CODES:**
- G61.89 - Other inflammatory polyneuropathies
- G62.9 - Polyneuropathy, unspecified (pre-diagnosis)

---

**KEY CLINICAL FEATURES:**
- Progressive or relapsing symmetric proximal AND distal weakness
- Sensory symptoms (numbness, paresthesias, sensory ataxia)
- Hyporeflexia or areflexia
- Duration >8 weeks (distinguishes from GBS)
- Elevated CSF protein with normal cell count (albuminocytologic dissociation)
- Electrodiagnostic evidence of demyelination

**CIDP VARIANTS:**
| Variant | Features | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Typical CIDP | Symmetric proximal and distal weakness, sensory loss | Most common (~50%) |
| MADSAM (Lewis-Sumner) | Multifocal, asymmetric; sensorimotor | May mimic MMN |
| DADS | Distal acquired demyelinating symmetric; sensory predominant | Often anti-MAG positive |
| Sensory CIDP | Pure sensory; ataxia, large fiber loss | NCS shows demyelination |
| Motor CIDP | Pure motor; no sensory involvement | Rare; consider MMN |
| Focal CIDP | Involvement of one or two limbs | Rare |

---

**EFNS/PNS DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (2021 Update):**

**Clinical Criteria:**
- Typical CIDP: Progressive or relapsing symmetric proximal and distal weakness AND sensory dysfunction of all extremities, developing over ≥8 weeks
- Cranial nerves may be affected
- Tendon reflexes reduced or absent in all limbs

**Supportive Criteria:**
- CSF protein elevated with WBC <10/mm³
- MRI showing nerve root or plexus enhancement or hypertrophy
- Objective clinical improvement following immunomodulatory treatment

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

---

!!! info "📋 CHRONIC DISEASE NOTE"
    CIDP is a chronic, treatable condition. Most patients respond to first-line immunotherapy. The goal is symptom control with minimal treatment burden. Long-term monitoring and periodic treatment adjustments are essential.

## 3. TREATMENT

**CRITICAL:** CIDP is treatable. First-line therapies (IVIg, corticosteroids, PLEX) are effective in ~80% of patients. Treatment choice depends on patient characteristics, access, and preference.

### Treatment Selection Guidance

| Factor | IVIg Preferred | Corticosteroids Preferred | PLEX Preferred |
|--------|----------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Pure motor CIDP** | Yes | Avoid (may worsen motor) | Yes |
| **Diabetes mellitus** | Yes | Avoid (worsens glycemic control) | Yes |
| **Cost/access concerns** | If covered | Yes (low cost) | Limited access |
| **Rapid response needed** | Yes | No (slow onset) | Yes |
| **Long-term therapy** | Maintenance possible | Taper to lowest dose; add steroid-sparing | Not practical |
| **Pregnancy** | Preferred | Avoid if possible | Safe |
| **Nodal/paranodal antibodies** | May be less effective | May be effective | May be effective; rituximab preferred |

## APPENDIX A: EFNS/PNS 2021 Diagnostic Criteria for CIDP

### Clinical Criteria

**Typical CIDP:**
- Progressive or relapsing symmetric proximal AND distal weakness
- Sensory dysfunction of all four limbs
- Developing over ≥8 weeks
- Reduced or absent tendon reflexes in all limbs

**Atypical CIDP (at least one of):**
- DADS: Predominantly distal weakness and sensory loss
- MADSAM: Asymmetric weakness (Lewis-Sumner syndrome)
- Focal: Single limb involvement
- Motor: Predominantly motor without sensory involvement
- Sensory: Predominantly sensory without motor involvement

### Electrodiagnostic Criteria (at least 1 nerve meeting criteria)

**Motor Nerve Criteria (must meet in ≥2 nerves for definite CIDP):**

| Parameter | Criterion |
|-----------|-----------|
| Distal motor latency | ≥50% above ULN |
| Motor conduction velocity | ≤70% below LLN |
| F-wave latency | ≥30% above ULN |
| Conduction block | ≥50% amplitude reduction proximal vs distal |
| Temporal dispersion | ≥30% increase in duration proximal vs distal |

### Supportive Criteria

1. **CSF:** Elevated protein with WBC <10/mm³
2. **MRI:** Enhancement or hypertrophy of nerve roots, brachial or lumbosacral plexus
3. **Objective clinical improvement** with immunomodulatory treatment
4. **Nerve ultrasound:** Increased cross-sectional area of peripheral nerves
5. **Nerve biopsy:** Evidence of demyelination/remyelination

### Diagnostic Categories

| Category | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Definite CIDP** | Clinical criteria + ≥2 nerves meeting electrodiagnostic criteria |
| **Probable CIDP** | Clinical criteria + 1 nerve meeting electrodiagnostic criteria |
| **Possible CIDP** | Clinical criteria but electrodiagnostic criteria not fully met; supportive criteria present |

## APPENDIX C: IVIg to SCIg Conversion Guide

### Conversion Formula

**Weekly SCIg dose = Monthly IVIg dose ÷ 4**

### Example Conversions

| Monthly IVIg Dose | Weekly SCIg Dose | Notes |
|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| 40 g (0.5 g/kg for 80 kg) | 10 g/week | Can divide into 2-3 infusions/week |
| 60 g (0.75 g/kg for 80 kg) | 15 g/week | Can divide into 3-4 infusions/week |
| 80 g (1 g/kg for 80 kg) | 20 g/week | May need 4-7 infusions/week |

### SCIg Administration

**Products:**
- Hizentra (20% concentration): Up to 25 mL per site
- Gamunex-C (10% concentration): Up to 30 mL per site

**Infusion Sites:**
- Abdomen, thighs, upper arms, hips
- Rotate sites; use 2-4 sites per infusion

**Advantages of SCIg:**
- Home administration
- Stable IgG levels (no peaks/troughs)
- Fewer systemic side effects
- Greater independence

**Training Required:**
- Initial training by infusion nurse (typically 2-3 sessions)
- Return demonstration of sterile technique
- Recognition of adverse reactions

## APPENDIX D: Monitoring Timeline

### First Year of Treatment

| Time | Monitoring |
|------|------------|
| Baseline | NCS/EMG, MRI (if not done), labs (CBC, CMP, HbA1c, SPEP/UPEP, immunoglobulins), INCAT score, grip strength |
| 2 weeks | If on IVIg: renal function |
| 4-6 weeks | Clinical assessment; titrate steroids |
| 3 months | Clinical exam, labs (CBC, CMP, LFTs if on immunosuppressants), HbA1c if on steroids |
| 6 months | Clinical exam, repeat NCS/EMG, INCAT score, labs |
| 12 months | Comprehensive review: NCS/EMG, DEXA (if on steroids), INCAT, consider dose reduction trial |

### Maintenance Phase (Annual)

- Clinical exam with INCAT/ONLS q6-12 months
- NCS/EMG if clinical change
- Labs: CBC, CMP, LFTs q3-6 months (based on therapy)
- DEXA q1-2 years if on steroids
- HbA1c q3-6 months if on steroids or diabetic
- Immunoglobulin levels q6-12 months if on IVIg/SCIg

### Dose Reduction Trial

Consider after 6-12 months of stable disease:
1. Reduce IVIg by 10-20% or extend interval by 1 week
2. Monitor closely over 4-8 weeks
3. If stable, continue slow reduction
4. If worsening, return to prior effective dose
5. Some patients require lifelong therapy; others may achieve drug-free remission
