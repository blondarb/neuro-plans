# Multiple System Atrophy

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 30, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)

**ICD-10:** G90.3 (Multi-system degeneration of the autonomic nervous system), G23.2 (Striatonigral degeneration — MSA-P), G23.3 (Multiple system atrophy, cerebellar type — MSA-C)

**SYNONYMS:** Multiple system atrophy, MSA, MSA-P, MSA-C, MSA-parkinsonian type, MSA-cerebellar type, striatonigral degeneration, sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy, OPCA, Shy-Drager syndrome, atypical parkinsonism, autonomic failure with parkinsonism, autonomic failure with cerebellar ataxia, multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism, multiple system atrophy with predominant cerebellar ataxia, alpha-synucleinopathy, neurodegenerative autonomic failure

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis and comprehensive management of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P and MSA-C) in adults. Covers 2022 MDS diagnostic criteria, autonomic function testing, neuroimaging, symptomatic management of autonomic failure (orthostatic hypotension, urogenital dysfunction), motor symptoms (parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia), sleep disorders (REM sleep behavior disorder, stridor), and multidisciplinary care. Excludes Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), pure autonomic failure (PAF), and hereditary cerebellar ataxias.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**

- **MSA-P (Parkinsonian type):** MSA with predominant parkinsonism (bradykinesia, rigidity) — formerly striatonigral degeneration
- **MSA-C (Cerebellar type):** MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (gait ataxia, limb ataxia, cerebellar dysarthria, oculomotor dysfunction) — formerly sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy
- **Orthostatic hypotension (OH):** Sustained reduction of SBP ≥20 mmHg or DBP ≥10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing or head-up tilt
- **Neurogenic OH:** OH caused by failure of autonomic reflexes (as opposed to volume depletion or medication effect)
- **Supine hypertension:** SBP ≥140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥90 mmHg in supine position; common in MSA and complicates OH treatment

---

**DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (2022 MDS Criteria for MSA):**

**Clinically Established MSA:**
- Autonomic dysfunction (neurogenic OH with SBP drop ≥20 mmHg or DBP drop ≥10 mmHg within 3 min of standing, OR urinary retention/incontinence with post-void residual ≥100 mL)
- PLUS poorly levodopa-responsive parkinsonism (MSA-P) OR cerebellar syndrome (MSA-C)
- PLUS at least 1 additional feature: RBD, stridor, contractures, postural instability within 3 years, rapid progression, poor levodopa response, dysphagia within 5 years, atrophy on MRI (putaminal, pontine, cerebellar, or MCP)

**Clinically Probable MSA:**
- Parkinsonism (poorly levodopa-responsive) or cerebellar syndrome
- PLUS at least 1 autonomic feature (OH not meeting criteria, urinary urgency/frequency, erectile dysfunction)
- PLUS at least 1 additional feature from above list

**Possible Prodromal MSA (Neuropathologically Established requires autopsy):**
- REM sleep behavior disorder with onset after age 40
- PLUS autonomic dysfunction (unexplained OH, urogenital dysfunction, or sudomotor failure)
- No parkinsonism or cerebellar ataxia yet

**Key Supportive Features:**
- Orofacial dystonia (risus sardonicus)
- Disproportionate antecollis
- Camptocormia or Pisa syndrome
- Inspiratory stridor
- Cold, discolored hands/feet
- Pathological laughter or crying (pseudobulbar affect)
- Jerky myoclonic tremor (polyminimyoclonus)

**Red Flags AGAINST MSA:**
- Sustained excellent levodopa response (>5 years)
- Visual hallucinations (suggests DLB)
- Dementia within first year (suggests DLB)
- Alien limb phenomenon (suggests CBD)
- Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy (suggests PSP)
- Family history of parkinsonism or ataxia

### 4B. Patient/Family Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| MSA is a progressive neurodegenerative disease; treatments manage symptoms but do not slow progression — early goals of care discussion recommended | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Rise slowly from lying to sitting to standing (staged position changes over 1-2 minutes) to minimize orthostatic hypotension episodes | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Increase dietary salt intake to 6-10 g/day and fluid intake to 2-2.5 L/day unless contraindicated by heart failure or renal disease | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Elevate head of bed 10-15 degrees (4-6 inch blocks) at night to reduce nocturnal supine hypertension and morning orthostatic symptoms | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Avoid large carbohydrate-heavy meals (eat smaller, more frequent meals) to prevent postprandial hypotension | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Do NOT stop orthostatic hypotension medications abruptly; these require gradual tapering under physician guidance | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |

## NOTES

- MSA is a rapidly progressive alpha-synucleinopathy with median survival of 6-10 years from symptom onset
- Two main phenotypes: MSA-P (parkinsonian predominant, ~60% in Western populations) and MSA-C (cerebellar predominant, more common in East Asian populations)
- Autonomic failure is the hallmark and appears EARLY, distinguishing MSA from Parkinson's disease
- Only ~30% of MSA-P patients show a partial and usually transient response to levodopa; response typically wanes within 1-5 years
- Supine hypertension is extremely common and complicates OH management; avoid midodrine/droxidopa within 4 hours of bedtime; elevate HOB 10-15 degrees
- Stridor from bilateral vocal cord abductor paralysis is a life-threatening complication and cause of sudden death in MSA; urgent laryngoscopy and CPAP/tracheostomy may be needed
- REM sleep behavior disorder precedes motor symptoms by years or decades and is one of the strongest prodromal markers
- No disease-modifying therapy currently exists; all treatment is symptomatic and supportive
- Medications that worsen autonomic dysfunction should be avoided: alpha-blockers, diuretics, vasodilators, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics with alpha-blocking properties
- Early palliative care integration is recommended given prognosis and symptom complexity
- MIBG cardiac scintigraphy is a useful distinguishing test: PRESERVED uptake in MSA vs REDUCED in PD and DLB
