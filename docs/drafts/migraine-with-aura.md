# Migraine with Aura

**DIAGNOSIS:** Migraine with Aura
**ICD-10:** G43.109 (Migraine with aura, not intractable, without status migrainosus), G43.101 (with status migrainosus), G43.119 (intractable, without status migrainosus), G43.111 (intractable, with status migrainosus), G43.409 (Hemiplegic migraine, not intractable), G43.419 (Hemiplegic migraine, intractable)
**SYNONYMS:** Classic migraine, migraine with typical aura, hemiplegic migraine, familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM), sporadic hemiplegic migraine, visual migraine, ophthalmic migraine, acephalgic migraine, migraine aura without headache, scintillating scotoma, fortification spectra
**SCOPE:** Diagnosis and management of migraine with typical aura (visual, sensory, language) and hemiplegic migraine. Focuses on outpatient management with acute care considerations. Covers differentiation from TIA/stroke, contraceptive counseling, and preventive therapy. Excludes migraine with brainstem aura (separate protocol) and retinal migraine.

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** January 27, 2026
**REVISED:** January 30, 2026

**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

**CLINICAL NOTES:**
- Aura typically precedes headache by 5-60 minutes but can occur during or without headache
- **Triptans ARE safe in typical migraine with aura** (visual, sensory, language)
- **Triptans/ergots CONTRAINDICATED in hemiplegic migraine** (motor aura)
- **Estrogen-containing contraceptives contraindicated** - elevated ischemic stroke risk
- Always differentiate from TIA/stroke on first presentation

| Return immediately for headache with fever, stiff neck, or altered mental status which may indicate CNS infection | STAT | - | ROUTINE |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Regular sleep schedule (7-8 hours, consistent bedtime) as sleep changes are a major aura trigger | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Avoid known aura triggers (bright/flashing lights, high altitude, significant sleep deprivation, extreme stress) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Regular aerobic exercise (30 min moderate activity 5x/week) reduces migraine frequency; avoid if currently in aura | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Magnesium-rich diet (leafy greens, nuts, whole grains) or supplementation as magnesium specifically helps aura | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Stress management techniques (mindfulness, biofeedback, relaxation training) as stress is a major trigger | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Adequate hydration (at least 64 oz water daily) as dehydration can trigger attacks | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Smoking cessation to reduce vascular risk, particularly important given aura-associated stroke risk | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Caffeine moderation (≤200 mg/day) and consistent daily intake to avoid withdrawal triggers | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Blood pressure control (target <130/80) given elevated vascular risk with aura | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |
| Avoid high altitude or rapid altitude changes if altitude is a known aura trigger | - | - | ROUTINE |

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Transient ischemic attack (TIA) | Sudden onset (maximal at onset vs gradual aura spread); negative symptoms (vision loss vs positive scintillations); vascular risk factors; older age; duration usually <1 hr | MRI DWI (no restriction in aura); MRA/CTA (no vessel occlusion); aura has visual "march" |
| Ischemic stroke | Fixed deficit; sudden onset; vascular territory distribution; risk factors | MRI DWI (shows restriction); CT may be normal early |
| Migraine with brainstem aura | Aura includes brainstem symptoms (vertigo, tinnitus, decreased hearing, diplopia, ataxia, dysarthria, decreased LOC) | Clinical criteria; MRI to exclude posterior fossa lesion |
| Retinal migraine | Monocular visual symptoms (vs binocular in typical aura); complete vision loss in one eye | Ophthalmology exam; cover/uncover test during symptoms |
| Focal seizure with visual phenomena | Shorter duration (seconds to minutes); positive phenomena; may have automatisms; post-ictal confusion | EEG may show epileptiform activity; MRI for structural lesion |
| Transient global amnesia | Anterograde amnesia; repetitive questioning; no visual or motor symptoms; resolves <24 hr | Clinical diagnosis; MRI may show hippocampal DWI changes |
| Giant cell arteritis | Age >50; scalp tenderness; jaw claudication; visual loss (not scintillations); elevated ESR/CRP | ESR, CRP (elevated); temporal artery biopsy |
| Carotid/vertebral dissection | Neck pain; Horner syndrome; pulsatile tinnitus; stroke symptoms | MRA/CTA neck showing dissection |
| CADASIL | Migraine with aura often first symptom; subcortical strokes; family history; cognitive decline | MRI shows characteristic WMH (anterior temporal, external capsule); NOTCH3 mutation |
| Mitochondrial encephalopathy (MELAS) | Stroke-like episodes not following vascular territory; seizures; elevated lactate; short stature | MRI (non-vascular stroke pattern); genetic testing; muscle biopsy |

## APPENDIX A: Aura Types and Characteristics

### Typical Aura Features (ICHD-3 Criteria)

| Aura Type | Characteristics | Duration | Positive/Negative Symptoms |
|-----------|----------------|----------|---------------------------|
| **Visual** (most common ~90%) | Scintillating scotoma, fortification spectra (zigzag lines), photopsia (flashes), spreading across visual field | 5-60 min | Positive (flashes, lines) then negative (scotoma) |
| **Sensory** (~30%) | Paresthesias (pins/needles) typically starting in hand, spreading up arm, then to face/tongue | 5-60 min | Positive (tingling) may be followed by numbness |
| **Language/Speech** (~10%) | Dysphasia, word-finding difficulty, paraphasic errors | 5-60 min | Negative (difficulty speaking) |
| **Motor** (hemiplegic migraine) | Unilateral weakness involving arm and/or leg | Minutes to days | Negative (weakness); TRIPTANS CONTRAINDICATED |

### Visual Aura "March" Pattern

The classic visual aura demonstrates a characteristic march:
1. **Starts** as small flickering spot near center of vision
2. **Expands** outward with scintillating (zigzag, fortress-like) border
3. **Leaves** scotoma (blind spot) in its wake
4. **Duration** typically 20-30 minutes
5. **Followed by** headache within 60 minutes (usually)

**Key Differentiator from Stroke:** Aura symptoms SPREAD gradually over 5+ minutes; stroke symptoms are maximal at onset.

### Hemiplegic Migraine Special Considerations

| Feature | Management Implication |
|---------|----------------------|
| Motor weakness present | **NO TRIPTANS, NO ERGOTS** - potential vasoconstriction risk |
| Weakness may last hours to days | Requires stroke rule-out; observation may be needed |
| Familial form (FHM) | Genetic counseling; CACNA1A, ATP1A2, SCN1A testing |
| May have brainstem symptoms | Consider migraine with brainstem aura overlap |
| Prevention | Verapamil, flunarizine, acetazolamide preferred; avoid beta-blockers in FHM type 1 |

## APPENDIX B: Contraceptive Guidance for Migraine with Aura

### Why Estrogen is Contraindicated

- Migraine with aura increases ischemic stroke risk 2-4x baseline
- Estrogen-containing contraceptives increase stroke risk 2-4x
- **Combined risk: 6-8x increased stroke risk** (multiplicative)
- Risk highest in women who smoke or have other vascular risk factors

### Safe Contraceptive Options

| Method | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Copper IUD (Paragard) | Non-hormonal | Highly effective; no hormone exposure |
| Levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena, Liletta) | Progestin-only | Minimal systemic absorption; highly effective |
| Progestin-only pill (mini-pill) | Progestin-only | Must take at same time daily; less effective than combined |
| Depo-Provera | Progestin-only | IM injection q3 months |
| Nexplanon (etonogestrel implant) | Progestin-only | 3-year subdermal implant; highly effective |
| Condoms, diaphragm | Barrier | No hormones; less effective |

### Contraceptives to AVOID

| Method | Why Contraindicated |
|--------|---------------------|
| Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) | Contains estrogen - elevated stroke risk |
| Contraceptive patch (Xulane) | Contains estrogen |
| Vaginal ring (NuvaRing) | Contains estrogen |

### Counseling Points

1. Document contraceptive method and provide alternatives
2. If patient is on estrogen, counsel on immediate discontinuation
3. Refer to OB/GYN for contraceptive transition
4. Discuss emergency contraception options (progestin-only preferred)
5. Address pregnancy planning if relevant
