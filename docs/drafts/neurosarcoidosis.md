# Neurosarcoidosis

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 30, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Neurosarcoidosis

**ICD-10:** D86.82 (Sarcoid meningitis), D86.89 (Sarcoidosis of other sites), D86.9 (Sarcoidosis, unspecified), G53 (Cranial nerve disorders in diseases classified elsewhere)

**SYNONYMS:** Neurosarcoidosis, neurosarcoid, CNS sarcoidosis, sarcoid neuropathy, sarcoid meningitis, sarcoid myelopathy, sarcoid cranial neuropathy, sarcoid optic neuropathy, granulomatous meningitis, sarcoid hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, sarcoid hydrocephalus, sarcoid mass lesion, neuro-sarcoid, sarcoidosis with nervous system involvement, central nervous system sarcoidosis

**SCOPE:** Diagnostic workup and management of suspected or confirmed neurosarcoidosis across all neurological presentations: cranial neuropathies, aseptic meningitis, hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, hydrocephalus, and mass lesions. Covers Zajicek diagnostic criteria (definite, probable, possible), acute immunotherapy, steroid-sparing agents, and long-term immunosuppression. For isolated pulmonary or systemic sarcoidosis without neurological involvement, defer to pulmonology. For other granulomatous CNS diseases (e.g., granulomatosis with polyangiitis, TB meningitis), use respective templates.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Definite Neurosarcoidosis (Zajicek criteria):** Biopsy of nervous system tissue demonstrating non-caseating granulomas, with other causes excluded
- **Probable Neurosarcoidosis:** CNS inflammation (elevated CSF protein/cells, MRI abnormalities, or positive brain/spine biopsy consistent with neurosarcoidosis) PLUS evidence of systemic sarcoidosis (biopsy-confirmed)
- **Possible Neurosarcoidosis:** Clinical and MRI findings suggestive of neurosarcoidosis without tissue confirmation of systemic or nervous system sarcoidosis

### LUMBAR PUNCTURE

**Indication:** Essential for diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis; CSF abnormalities support diagnosis (lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, low glucose); CSF ACE level; rules out infectious meningitis (TB, fungal, bacterial); rules out CNS lymphoma and carcinomatous meningitis

**Timing:** URGENT in ED/hospital setting; ROUTINE for outpatient workup. Perform after CT head to rule out mass effect/hydrocephalus

**Volume Required:** 15-20 mL (sufficient for comprehensive infectious, inflammatory, and cytology studies)

|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|----------------|
| Opening pressure (CPT 89050) | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Elevated ICP assessment; hydrocephalus from meningeal involvement | 10-20 cm H2O (often elevated in neurosarcoidosis) |

| Adenosine deaminase (ADA) (CPT 86235) | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Elevated in TB meningitis (>10 IU/L); helps differentiate TB from sarcoid | Normal (<10 IU/L) |

**Special Handling:** CSF ACE level requires prompt processing; send AFB and fungal cultures in sufficient volume (minimum 2 mL each). Cytology requires rapid transport (<1 hour). Store extra CSF (frozen at -20C) for future testing.

**Contraindications:** Elevated ICP without imaging (get CT first); coagulopathy (INR >1.5, platelets <50K); skin infection at LP site; obstructive hydrocephalus with risk of herniation

*Note: Anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab) are the most effective biologic therapies for refractory neurosarcoidosis. Infliximab has the most evidence. ALWAYS exclude latent TB before starting anti-TNF therapy (granulomatous infection can be catastrophically reactivated). Treatment duration is typically 1-2 years minimum; relapse is common on discontinuation. Rituximab and cyclophosphamide are reserved for cases refractory to anti-TNF agents.*

## CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT NOTES

### Zajicek Diagnostic Criteria for Neurosarcoidosis

**Definite Neurosarcoidosis:**
- [ ] Nervous system biopsy demonstrating non-caseating granulomas
- [ ] Other causes of granulomatous inflammation excluded (TB, fungal, foreign body)

**Probable Neurosarcoidosis:**
- [ ] Evidence of CNS inflammation (CSF abnormalities: elevated protein, pleocytosis, oligoclonal bands) AND/OR MRI abnormalities consistent with neurosarcoidosis AND/OR positive brain/spine biopsy
- [ ] Evidence of systemic sarcoidosis confirmed by tissue biopsy (lung, lymph node, skin, etc.)
- [ ] Other causes excluded

**Possible Neurosarcoidosis:**
- [ ] Clinical and/or MRI features suggestive of neurosarcoidosis
- [ ] No tissue confirmation of sarcoidosis (systemic or nervous system)
- [ ] Other causes excluded to the extent possible

### Updated Stern/Sarcoidosis Consortium Criteria (2018)

- **Type 1 (Definite):** Nervous system pathology consistent with neurosarcoidosis + exclusion of other causes
- **Type 2 (Probable):** Systemic biopsy-proven sarcoidosis + typical neurological syndrome + exclusion of other causes
- **Type 3 (Possible):** Typical neurological syndrome + no tissue confirmation + exclusion of other causes

### Common Presentations of Neurosarcoidosis

| Presentation | Frequency | Key Features |
|-------------|-----------|-------------- |
| Cranial neuropathy | 50-70% | CN VII (facial palsy) most common; CN II (optic neuropathy) second; may be bilateral; any CN can be involved |
| Aseptic meningitis | 10-25% | Headache, meningismus; CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis; may be chronic/relapsing |
| Hypothalamic-pituitary | 5-15% | Diabetes insipidus; hyperprolactinemia; central hypothyroidism; hypogonadism; SIADH |
| Myelopathy | 5-10% | Subacute; thoracic predominance; dorsal subpial enhancement; may mimic MS or NMOSD |
| Hydrocephalus | 5-10% | Communicating (meningeal) or obstructive; may require VP shunt |
| Mass lesion (granuloma) | 5-10% | Mimics tumor; dural-based or parenchymal; may cause seizures, focal deficits |
| Peripheral neuropathy | 15-40% | Small fiber neuropathy (most common); mononeuritis multiplex; polyradiculopathy |
| Seizures | 5-10% | From cortical/meningeal involvement; may be presenting feature |
| Cognitive/psychiatric | 5-20% | Memory impairment; confusion; depression; personality changes |

### Red Flags Suggesting Neurosarcoidosis

- [ ] Bilateral facial nerve palsy (especially in young African American patient)
- [ ] Cranial neuropathy + bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest imaging
- [ ] Chronic meningitis with lymphocytic pleocytosis + elevated CSF ACE
- [ ] Diabetes insipidus + hypothalamic/pituitary stalk enhancement on MRI
- [ ] Leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI (especially basilar) + systemic sarcoidosis
- [ ] Optic neuropathy + hilar adenopathy + elevated serum ACE
- [ ] Myelopathy with dorsal subpial enhancement ("trident sign") on spine MRI
- [ ] Small fiber neuropathy with multisystem granulomatous disease
- [ ] Erythema nodosum or lupus pernio + new neurological symptoms

### Scadding Staging (Chest Imaging)

| Stage | Findings | Frequency in Sarcoidosis |
|-------|----------|--------------------------|
| 0 | Normal chest imaging | 5-10% |
| I | Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL) only | ~50% |
| II | BHL + pulmonary infiltrates | ~25% |
| III | Pulmonary infiltrates without BHL | ~15% |
| IV | Pulmonary fibrosis | ~5% |
