# Post-Concussion Syndrome

**CPT CODES:** 99213-99215 (Office visit), 96116 (Neurobehavioral status exam), 96132-96133 (Neuropsychological testing evaluation), 96136-96139 (Neuropsychological testing administration), 97110 (Therapeutic exercises - vestibular rehab), 97112 (Neuromuscular reeducation), 97530 (Therapeutic activities - cognitive rehab), 70551 (MRI brain without contrast), 70553 (MRI brain with and without contrast), 95816 (EEG routine), 95819 (EEG with sleep)

**SYNONYMS:** Post-concussion syndrome, PCS, postconcussional syndrome, persistent post-concussive symptoms, PPCS, post-concussive disorder, post-concussion disorder, postconcussion syndrome, chronic concussion symptoms, persistent concussion symptoms, prolonged concussion recovery, post-traumatic syndrome, mild TBI sequelae, chronic post-traumatic headache, post-traumatic cognitive impairment, concussion with persistent symptoms, post-concussional disorder, postconcussive syndrome, complicated concussion, post-mild TBI syndrome, post-head injury syndrome, post-head trauma syndrome, chronic concussion, lingering concussion symptoms, slow concussion recovery

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of persistent symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or concussion in adults, defined as symptom persistence beyond 3 months from injury. Covers symptom-specific pharmacologic management (headache, dizziness, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbance, mood changes), vestibular rehabilitation, cognitive rehabilitation, graded return-to-activity protocols, neuropsychological testing, and mental health screening/treatment. Applicable primarily in outpatient setting with ED and inpatient considerations for acute re-evaluation. Excludes acute concussion management (first 0-4 weeks), moderate-severe TBI, pediatric concussion, and sports-specific return-to-play protocols.

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Concussion / Mild TBI:** Traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function; GCS 13-15, LOC <30 minutes, PTA <24 hours
- **Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS):** Persistence of 3 or more concussion symptoms (headache, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, insomnia, concentration/memory difficulty) for >3 months after mTBI
- **Post-Traumatic Headache (PTH):** Headache developing within 7 days of head injury or regaining consciousness after injury; persistent if >3 months
- **Persistent Post-Concussive Symptoms (PPCS):** Current preferred terminology for symptoms lasting beyond expected recovery window (>4 weeks to 3 months)
- **Post-Traumatic Vestibular Dysfunction:** Dizziness and balance impairment following TBI, may include BPPV, vestibular hypofunction, or central vestibular dysfunction
- **Cognitive Fatigue:** Disproportionate mental exhaustion with cognitive effort, common in PCS

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Chronic migraine | Pre-existing headache history before injury; meets ICHD-3 chronic migraine criteria independent of trauma | Headache diary, pre-injury history |
| Cervicogenic headache | Neck pain predominant, headache triggered by neck movement/posture, limited cervical ROM | Cervical exam, diagnostic block, cervical MRI |
| Subdural hematoma (chronic) | Progressive headache, cognitive decline, focal deficits; risk with anticoagulation, elderly, falls | CT head, MRI brain |
| Depression / Anxiety disorder | Mood symptoms predate injury or disproportionate to injury severity; lack of cognitive deficits on testing | PHQ-9, GAD-7, neuropsychological testing |
| PTSD (Post-traumatic stress disorder) | Re-experiencing trauma, avoidance, hyperarousal; nightmares; may overlap significantly with PCS | PCL-5, psychiatric evaluation |
| Post-traumatic hypopituitarism | Fatigue, weight changes, hyponatremia, sexual dysfunction; can present months after TBI | Pituitary hormones (cortisol, TSH, IGF-1, testosterone) |
| Sleep apnea (new or worsened post-TBI) | Excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, witnessed apneas, morning headache | Polysomnography |
| Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) | Positional vertigo (brief episodes), positive Dix-Hallpike | Dix-Hallpike maneuver, VNG |
| Medication side effects | Symptoms correlate with medication initiation/dose changes | Medication review, trial discontinuation |
| Functional neurological disorder (FND) | Inconsistent exam findings, distractibility signs, Hoover sign | Clinical exam, neuropsychological testing |
| Whiplash-associated disorder | Neck pain predominant, limited ROM, no LOC at injury | Cervical imaging, clinical exam |
| Idiopathic intracranial hypertension | Headache with papilledema, visual obscurations, pulsatile tinnitus | Fundoscopy, LP with opening pressure, MRV |
| CNS infection | Fever, meningismus, progressive course | CBC, LP, MRI with contrast |
| Malingering / Symptom exaggeration | Medicolegal context, inconsistent performance, effort testing failure | Neuropsychological testing with embedded/stand-alone effort measures |
| Normal aging / Pre-existing cognitive impairment | Cognitive symptoms predate injury; stable rather than post-injury onset | Pre-injury cognitive testing, collateral history |

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Disposition | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Discharge from ED | Stable neurologic exam, no red flags on imaging (if obtained), no acute intervention needed, outpatient follow-up arranged, safety precautions reviewed |
| Admit to hospital | New or worsening neurologic deficit, suspected delayed intracranial hemorrhage, acute psychiatric crisis (suicidality), severe vestibular dysfunction preventing safe ambulation, inability to maintain hydration/nutrition |
| Outpatient follow-up schedule | Initial: 2-4 weeks post-injury; then q4-6 weeks until symptom resolution; neuropsychological testing at 3+ months if cognitive symptoms persist |
| Return to work/school | Gradual return with accommodations; symptom-dependent; coordinate with occupational medicine; may need reduced schedule, extra break time, modified duties |
| Return to exercise | Per graded protocol (Buffalo Treadmill Test); stepwise progression: (1) light aerobic, (2) moderate aerobic, (3) sport-specific, (4) non-contact drills, (5) full activity |
| Return to driving | When able to tolerate visual stimulation, has adequate reaction time, no dizziness/cognitive impairment at highway speeds; per physician clearance |
| Specialty referral thresholds | If no improvement at 4-6 weeks: neurology; if no improvement at 3 months: neuropsychology, multidisciplinary concussion program |

## NOTES

- Post-concussion syndrome is a clinical diagnosis; neuroimaging is often normal and does not rule out PCS
- **Most patients recover within 3 months**; 15-30% develop persistent symptoms
- Avoid prolonged cognitive and physical rest beyond 24-48 hours acutely — this may worsen outcomes
- Graded aerobic exercise (sub-symptom threshold) is the strongest evidence-based intervention for PCS recovery
- Post-traumatic headache is the most common symptom; treat with migraine prevention paradigm (amitriptyline first-line)
- **Avoid topiramate as first-line in PCS** due to cognitive side effects that may worsen PCS-related cognitive impairment
- **Avoid chronic benzodiazepine use** — impairs vestibular compensation and cognitive recovery
- Screen all PCS patients for depression, anxiety, and PTSD at each visit (PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCL-5)
- Post-traumatic hypopituitarism is underdiagnosed; screen with morning cortisol, TSH, IGF-1 if persistent fatigue
- Vestibular symptoms (dizziness, balance problems) respond well to targeted vestibular rehabilitation
- Cognitive symptoms correlate poorly with injury severity; neuropsychological testing provides objective measurement
- Multidisciplinary approach (neurology, neuropsychology, PT, OT, SLP, psychology) yields best outcomes
- Consider cervicogenic headache as co-contributor; whiplash and concussion frequently co-occur
- Secondary gain and medicolegal context do not preclude genuine symptoms but should be noted
- Effort testing during neuropsychological evaluation is standard to ensure valid results
