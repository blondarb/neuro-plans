**REVISED:** February 11, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft

**DIAGNOSIS:** Chorea Evaluation

**ICD-10:** G25.5 (Other chorea), G25.4 (Drug-induced chorea), G10 (Huntington disease), I02.9 (Rheumatic chorea — Sydenham), G25.0 (Essential tremor — when chorea is considered)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC), 80053 (CMP), 84443 (TSH), 84439 (Free T4), 82607 (Vitamin B12), 82390 (Ceruloplasmin), 82525 (Copper, serum), 82016 (24-hr urine copper), 86235 (ANA), 86200 (CRP), 85652 (ESR), 86146 (Antiphospholipid antibodies), 86147 (Lupus anticoagulant), 86200 (Anti-cardiolipin antibodies), 81401 (HTT gene testing), 86060 (ASO titer), 86163 (Complement C3/C4), 70553 (MRI brain), 78608 (FDG-PET brain), 95816 (EEG), 95907-95913 (NCS), 83036 (HbA1c)

**SYNONYMS:** chorea evaluation, chorea workup, choreiform movements, chorea differential diagnosis, involuntary movements evaluation, hyperkinetic movement disorder evaluation, Huntington chorea, Sydenham chorea, drug-induced chorea, autoimmune chorea, vascular chorea, metabolic chorea, choreiform disorder

**SCOPE:** Systematic evaluation of chorea in adults and adolescents. Covers the differential diagnosis approach to chorea including hereditary (Huntington disease, HD phenocopies), autoimmune (Sydenham, SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome), drug-induced (tardive, dopaminergic), metabolic (thyrotoxicosis, Wilson disease, hyper/hypoglycemia), vascular (post-stroke), and paraneoplastic etiologies. Includes treatment with VMAT2 inhibitors and symptomatic management. Excludes tardive dyskinesia as primary diagnosis (covered separately).

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Chorea:** Involuntary, irregular, purposeless, non-rhythmic movements that flow randomly from one body part to another; from Greek "choreia" (dance)
- **Ballism/Ballismus:** Proximal, large-amplitude choreiform movements; often hemiballismus from subthalamic nucleus lesion; represents severe end of chorea spectrum
- **Athetosis:** Slow, writhing, continuous movements; often seen with chorea (choreoathetosis)
- **Huntington disease (HD):** Autosomal dominant; CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in HTT gene (≥36 repeats); chorea, cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms
- **Sydenham chorea:** Post-streptococcal autoimmune chorea; anti-basal ganglia antibodies; predominantly affects children/adolescents; associated with rheumatic fever

## NOTES

- Always consider TREATABLE causes first: hyperglycemia, drug-induced, Wilson disease, autoimmune (SLE, APS), Sydenham, thyrotoxicosis
- Non-ketotic hyperglycemic hemichorea is one of the most common REVERSIBLE causes in elderly; look for T1 hyperintensity in contralateral putamen on MRI
- Huntington disease gene testing REQUIRES genetic counseling before ordering due to profound implications for patient and family (insurance, employment, reproductive decisions)
- VMAT2 inhibitors (deutetrabenazine, tetrabenazine, valbenazine) are first-line for chronic chorea suppression; deutetrabenazine has the best side-effect profile
- Tetrabenazine carries a BLACK BOX WARNING for depression and suicidality — screen at every visit (PHQ-9)
- Wilson disease must be excluded in ALL patients <50 with unexplained chorea (ceruloplasmin, slit-lamp exam, 24-hr urine copper)
- Sydenham chorea is self-limiting (weeks to months) but requires secondary streptococcal prophylaxis to prevent rheumatic heart disease recurrence
- Chorea-acanthocytosis is rare but important: look for lip/tongue biting, feeding dystonia, elevated CK, and acanthocytes on peripheral smear
- Acute severe hemiballismus (usually from subthalamic nucleus lesion) may require emergent treatment with IV haloperidol or valproic acid
- Drug-induced chorea: common offenders include levodopa, dopamine agonists, stimulants, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, and carbamazepine
