# Myelopathy — General Evaluation

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** February 11, 2026
**REVISED:** February 11, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft — Pending Review

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC with differential), 80053 (CMP), 85652 (ESR), 86140 (CRP), 87040 (Blood cultures x2), 82607 (Vitamin B12 level), 83921 (Methylmalonic acid), 82390 (Ceruloplasmin), 84630 (Zinc level), 82525 (Copper level), 84443 (TSH), 86592 (RPR/VDRL), 87389 (HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody), 86687 (HTLV-1/2 antibody), 86255 (AQP4-IgG aquaporin-4 antibody serum), 86235 (ANA), 82164 (ACE level serum), 86334 (SPEP), 72156 (MRI cervical spine with and without contrast), 72157 (MRI thoracic spine with and without contrast), 72158 (MRI lumbar spine with and without contrast), 70553 (MRI brain with and without contrast), 72125 (CT cervical spine without contrast), 71046 (Chest X-ray), 95907 (NCS), 95886 (EMG), 95925 (SSEPs), 62270 (Lumbar puncture), 89051 (Cell count with differential), 84157 (Protein), 82945 (Glucose with paired serum), 83916 (Oligoclonal bands), 86327 (IgG index), 88104 (Cytology), 96365 (IV infusion first hour)

**SYNONYMS:** Myelopathy, spinal cord dysfunction, myelopathic syndrome, spinal cord disease, cord compression evaluation, myelopathy workup, upper motor neuron syndrome spinal, spinal cord lesion evaluation, compressive myelopathy, non-compressive myelopathy

**SCOPE:** General myelopathy evaluation — systematic differential diagnosis approach for patients presenting with myelopathic signs and symptoms (upper motor neuron weakness, sensory level, bowel/bladder dysfunction, gait disturbance). Covers algorithmic workup to differentiate compressive (degenerative, neoplastic, abscess, hematoma) from non-compressive (inflammatory/demyelinating, infectious, vascular, metabolic, paraneoplastic) etiologies. Provides initial stabilization and empiric management across all settings. Complements the Acute Myelopathy plan (focused on acute/subacute emergency presentations) and the Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy plan (focused on degenerative cervical spine disease). This template is designed as a starting framework for any patient with suspected myelopathy where the etiology is uncertain.

### LUMBAR PUNCTURE (CPT 62270)

**Indication:** All suspected non-compressive myelopathies require LP. Perform AFTER MRI (exclude compressive cause and epidural abscess first — LP through abscess risks seeding meningitis). Also indicated when etiology remains uncertain after imaging.

**Timing:** URGENT in acute/subacute presentations after MRI confirms non-compressive etiology; ROUTINE in outpatient chronic myelopathy evaluation.

**Volume Required:** 20-25 mL (comprehensive panel requires multiple tubes for demyelinating, infectious, inflammatory, and malignancy studies)

| Cryptococcal antigen | Cryptococcal myelitis — immunocompromised patients (HIV, transplant) | Negative | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE |

**Special Handling:** CSF oligoclonal bands require paired serum sample drawn same day. Cytology must be processed within 1 hour of collection (cells degrade rapidly). AFB culture requires specialized media.

**Contraindications:** Coagulopathy (INR >1.5, platelets <50K); anticoagulation (hold per guidelines); compressive epidural lesion not yet evaluated surgically; skin infection at puncture site; signs of increased ICP with mass lesion (obtain imaging first).
