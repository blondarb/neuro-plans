# Syncope Evaluation

**DIAGNOSIS:** Syncope and Collapse
**ICD-10:** R55 (Syncope and collapse)
**ADDITIONAL ICD-10:** T67.1 (Heat syncope), I95.1 (Orthostatic hypotension), G90.0 (Idiopathic peripheral autonomic neuropathy), G90.3 (Multi-system degeneration of ANS), R00.1 (Bradycardia), I49.9 (Cardiac arrhythmia, unspecified), F48.8 (Psychogenic syncope)
**CLINICAL SYNONYMS:** Fainting, passing out, blackout, loss of consciousness, LOC, vasovagal episode, neurocardiogenic syncope, vasodepressor syncope, reflex syncope
**SCOPE:** Comprehensive evaluation of transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) due to cerebral hypoperfusion. Covers vasovagal/reflex syncope, orthostatic hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and neurologic mimics. Includes risk stratification, diagnostic workup, and management. Excludes seizure-related loss of consciousness (see Seizure plan), stroke, and metabolic causes of altered mental status.

**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

## APPENDIX A: Risk Stratification Tools

### San Francisco Syncope Rule (SFSR)

**Purpose:** Identify patients at risk for serious outcomes within 30 days

**High-risk features (any one = high risk):**
- **C** - Congestive heart failure history
- **H** - Hematocrit <30%
- **E** - ECG abnormality (non-sinus rhythm or new changes)
- **S** - Shortness of breath
- **S** - Systolic BP <90 mmHg at any time

**Interpretation:**
- No criteria present = Low risk (~2% 7-day serious outcome)
- Any criteria present = High risk (~15-25% serious outcome); consider admission

**Sensitivity:** 96-98% for serious outcomes

### Canadian Syncope Risk Score (CSRS)

**Purpose:** More precise risk stratification than SFSR; validated for 30-day serious outcomes

**Score Calculation:**

| Variable | Points |
|----------|--------|
| **Predisposition to vasovagal symptoms** | -1 |
| **Heart disease history or elevated BNP** | +1 |
| **Any systolic BP reading <90 or >180 mmHg** | +2 |
| **Troponin elevated (>99th percentile ULN)** | +2 |
| **Abnormal QRS axis (<-30 or >100 degrees)** | +1 |
| **QRS duration >130 ms** | +1 |
| **QTc >480 ms** | +2 |
| **ED diagnosis of cardiac syncope** | +2 |
| **ED diagnosis of vasovagal syncope** | -2 |

**Risk Categories:**

| Score | Risk Category | 30-day Serious Outcome |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|
| -3 to -2 | Very Low | 0.4% |
| -1 to 0 | Low | 1.2% |
| 1 to 3 | Medium | 3.1% |
| 4 to 5 | High | 9.5% |
| 6 to 11 | Very High | 28.9% |

**Management Guidance:**
- Very Low/Low: Consider discharge with outpatient follow-up
- Medium: Consider ED observation or short stay
- High/Very High: Admission for monitoring and evaluation

### Red Flags Requiring Urgent Evaluation

| Category | Concerning Features |
|----------|---------------------|
| **History** | Exertional syncope; supine syncope; syncope without prodrome; palpitations immediately before event; family history of sudden death <50 yo |
| **Cardiac** | Known structural heart disease; heart failure; prior MI; aortic stenosis murmur; ICD shocks |
| **ECG** | Long QT (>480 ms); short QT (<340 ms); Brugada pattern; delta wave (WPW); epsilon wave (ARVC); AV block; wide QRS; new ischemia |
| **Event** | Significant injury requiring treatment; syncope while driving; recurrent episodes (>3/year) |

---

## APPENDIX B: Seizure vs Syncope Differentiation

### Clinical Features Comparison

| Feature | Syncope | Seizure |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Trigger** | Usually present (standing, pain, heat) | Usually absent (except photosensitive or reflex) |
| **Prodrome** | Common (lightheadedness, warmth, nausea, vision change) | Rare; may have aura (olfactory, gustatory, deja vu) |
| **Duration of LOC** | Brief (<30 seconds typically) | Variable (30 sec to minutes) |
| **Movements during** | May have brief myoclonic jerks (convulsive syncope) | Sustained tonic-clonic activity; rhythmic |
| **Timing of movements** | After falling (due to hypoperfusion) | From onset or within seconds |
| **Eye position** | Closed or rolling up | Open; deviated or staring |
| **Tongue bite** | Rare; tip if present | Lateral tongue laceration (highly specific) |
| **Urinary incontinence** | Occasionally | Common |
| **Post-event confusion** | Brief (<30 seconds) | Prolonged (minutes to hours) |
| **Post-event fatigue** | Mild | Profound; may sleep for hours |
| **Pallor** | Prominent before and during | Usually absent |
| **Cyanosis** | Absent (initially pale) | May be present |
| **Memory of event** | Recalls prodrome; brief LOC | Amnesia for ictus; may recall aura |

### Diagnostic Testing

| Test | Findings Suggesting Seizure |
|------|----------------------------|
| **Prolactin** | >2x baseline if drawn within 20 minutes of event (sensitivity ~60%) |
| **CK** | Elevated 12-24 hours post-event if generalized tonic-clonic |
| **EEG** | Epileptiform discharges (spikes, sharp waves, spike-wave) |
| **MRI Brain** | Structural lesion; mesial temporal sclerosis; cortical dysplasia |

### Convulsive Syncope ("Fainting with Twitching")

- Occurs in up to 10-15% of syncope episodes
- Brief myoclonic jerks due to cerebral hypoperfusion
- Typically <30 seconds, less rhythmic than seizure
- Rapid recovery without prolonged confusion
- Does NOT require anticonvulsant treatment

---

## APPENDIX C: Driving Restrictions After Syncope

### General Principles

- Regulations vary by state/country
- Distinction between private and commercial drivers
- Must consider underlying etiology and treatment status

### Private Drivers (Non-Commercial)

| Diagnosis | Typical Restriction | Resume When |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Vasovagal syncope (single episode)** | Usually none | Prodrome present; avoidable trigger identified |
| **Vasovagal syncope (recurrent)** | Variable | 3-12 months symptom-free; effective prevention |
| **Unexplained syncope** | 6-12 months | Diagnosis established or 6-12 months event-free |
| **Cardiac syncope (arrhythmia)** | Until treated | Successful treatment (ablation, pacemaker, ICD); typically 1 week to 6 months |
| **Cardiac syncope (structural)** | Until treated | Surgical repair; stable on treatment |
| **Orthostatic hypotension** | Variable | Controlled on treatment; no syncope without prodrome |

### Commercial Drivers (CDL, Pilots, Heavy Equipment)

- More stringent restrictions apply
- Often require specialist clearance
- May require symptom-free period of 1-5 years
- Unexplained syncope often disqualifies from commercial driving
- Must report to appropriate regulatory agency

### Documentation Requirements

- Document counseling about driving restrictions in medical record
- Provide written instructions to patient
- Some jurisdictions require mandatory reporting to DMV
- Consider medical alert bracelet for frequent episodes

## APPENDIX D: Tilt Table Testing Protocol

### Indications

- Recurrent unexplained syncope affecting quality of life
- Single syncopal episode in high-risk setting (injury, driving, occupational hazard)
- Confirm diagnosis of vasovagal syncope when history equivocal
- Evaluate efficacy of treatment in recurrent reflex syncope
- Differentiate delayed orthostatic hypotension from reflex syncope

### Contraindications

- Recent MI or unstable angina (<30 days)
- Severe aortic stenosis
- Severe proximal coronary artery disease
- Severe mitral stenosis
- Known severe cerebrovascular disease

### Protocol (Italian Protocol Most Common)

1. **Baseline:** Patient supine for 5-20 minutes; establish baseline BP and HR
2. **Passive phase:** Tilt to 60-70 degrees for 20-45 minutes
3. **Drug provocation (if passive phase negative):**
   - Isoproterenol: 1-3 mcg/min IV while tilted
   - OR Nitroglycerin: 300-400 mcg sublingual while tilted
4. **Positive response:** Reproduce syncope with hypotension and/or bradycardia
5. **Return to supine** immediately upon positive response or symptoms

### Response Types

| Type | Hemodynamic Pattern |
|------|---------------------|
| **Type 1 (Mixed)** | HR falls but not <40 bpm for >10 sec; BP falls before HR |
| **Type 2A (Cardioinhibitory without asystole)** | HR <40 bpm for >10 sec; asystole <3 sec |
| **Type 2B (Cardioinhibitory with asystole)** | Asystole >3 sec; BP drop follows or occurs with HR drop |
| **Type 3 (Vasodepressor)** | HR doesn't fall >10% from peak; BP falls causing syncope |

### Treatment Implications

- **Vasodepressor (Type 3):** Lifestyle modifications; compression stockings; hydration/salt; consider midodrine
- **Cardioinhibitory with asystole (Type 2B):** Consider pacemaker if recurrent and refractory
- **Mixed (Type 1):** Lifestyle modifications first; pharmacotherapy rarely needed
