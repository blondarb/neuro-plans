### ANESTHESIA PRECAUTIONS (CRITICAL)

**ALL patients with muscular dystrophy require anesthesia precautions:**
- **AVOID succinylcholine** — risk of hyperkalemic cardiac arrest and rhabdomyolysis
- **AVOID inhaled anesthetic agents (halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane)** in dystrophinopathies (BMD/DMD) — malignant hyperthermia-like reactions
- Use non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (rocuronium with sugammadex reversal)
- Anesthesiologist should be aware of diagnosis and respiratory status preoperatively
- Post-operative respiratory monitoring in PACU/ICU given respiratory muscle weakness

## NOTES

- CRITICAL: ALL muscular dystrophy patients require anesthesia precautions — AVOID succinylcholine (hyperkalemic arrest) and inhaled anesthetics in dystrophinopathies
- Cardiac involvement is a LEADING cause of death in BMD, EDMD, and LGMD; proactive screening saves lives
- LMNA (lamin A/C) mutations carry very high risk of sudden cardiac death from conduction defects — prophylactic ICD/pacemaker should be considered even with normal EF
- FSHD is the most common adult-onset MD (~1:8,000-20,000); facial weakness may be subtle; scapular winging is often the first noticed feature
- CK levels vary dramatically by subtype: BMD/LGMD often 5-50x ULN; FSHD 1-5x ULN; OPMD often normal or minimally elevated
- Genetic testing has largely replaced muscle biopsy as the first-line diagnostic approach; biopsy reserved for inconclusive genetic results
- Muscle MRI can guide diagnosis by showing characteristic patterns of fatty infiltration specific to each dystrophy subtype
- Respiratory failure develops insidiously; FVC should be monitored regularly; initiate NIV when FVC <50% predicted or earlier if symptomatic
- Nocturnal hypoventilation (morning headaches, daytime somnolence) may precede daytime respiratory failure by months-years
- OPMD: late onset (50s-60s); ptosis and dysphagia are hallmark; cricopharyngeal myotomy can significantly improve swallowing
- Gene therapy trials are actively enrolling for multiple dystrophies; refer interested patients to clinical trial registries
- Eccentric/high-resistance exercise may worsen muscle damage in dystrophies; low-impact aerobic exercise is preferred
