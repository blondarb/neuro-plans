**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Occipital Neuralgia (ICHD-3 13.4):** Unilateral or bilateral paroxysmal, shooting or stabbing pain in the posterior part of the scalp, in the distribution(s) of the greater, lesser, and/or third occipital nerves, sometimes accompanied by diminished sensation or dysesthesia in the affected area; commonly associated with tenderness over the affected nerve(s)
- **Greater Occipital Nerve (GON):** Arises from the dorsal ramus of C2 (with contribution from C3); emerges between the obliquus capitis inferior and semispinalis capitis at the superior nuchal line, medial to the occipital artery
- **Lesser Occipital Nerve (LON):** Arises from the ventral rami of C2-C3; courses along the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle
- **Third Occipital Nerve (TON):** Arises from the dorsal ramus of C3; crosses the C2-C3 facet joint; innervates lower occipital region
- **Diagnostic Block Criteria (ICHD-3):** Pain is temporarily relieved by local anesthetic block of the affected nerve(s); this is both diagnostic and part of the formal criteria
- **Cervicogenic Headache:** Headache caused by a disorder of the cervical spine (C1-C3), distinguished from occipital neuralgia by its referred, non-neuralgic quality

### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|
| Avoid prolonged neck flexion (phone, computer) and sustained postures; take breaks every 30 minutes | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Postural strain exacerbates occipital nerve irritation |
| Apply warm compresses to suboccipital region for 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times daily | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Muscle relaxation; reduces spasm-related nerve compression |
| Perform gentle cervical stretching exercises as directed by physical therapy | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Reduces muscle tension; improves cervical mobility |
| Avoid tight headwear, helmets, or hairstyles that compress the occipital region | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | External compression is a known trigger for occipital neuralgia |
| Keep a headache diary recording frequency, severity (0-10), triggers, and medication use | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Tracks treatment response; identifies triggers and patterns |
| Return to ED immediately if sudden severe headache ("thunderclap"), fever, neck stiffness, vision changes, weakness, or numbness | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Red flags for secondary causes (SAH, meningitis, vertebral artery dissection) |
| Take medications exactly as prescribed; do not abruptly stop gabapentin, pregabalin, carbamazepine, or baclofen | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Abrupt discontinuation risks withdrawal seizures and rebound pain |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|
| Complete ergonomic workstation assessment and modification | - | - | ROUTINE | - | Reduces prolonged cervical strain; corrects forward head posture |
| Use cervical pillow and maintain neutral cervical alignment during sleep | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Improper sleep position compresses occipital nerves; maintain neutral cervical alignment |
| Engage in stress reduction techniques (mindfulness, biofeedback, cognitive behavioral therapy) | - | - | ROUTINE | - | Stress and muscle tension exacerbate occipital neuralgia; CBT shown effective for chronic pain |
| Maintain regular aerobic exercise (30 minutes, 5 days/week) | - | - | ROUTINE | - | Central pain modulation; improves overall pain tolerance; reduces comorbid depression |
| Limit caffeine intake to <200 mg/day and avoid abrupt caffeine withdrawal | - | - | ROUTINE | - | Caffeine withdrawal can trigger headache exacerbation; excessive use contributes to medication overuse |

| Vertebral artery dissection | Sudden severe occipital/neck pain; may have Horner syndrome, lateral medullary signs, stroke symptoms | CTA neck; MRA with fat suppression; onset is acute/sudden |
| Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) | Age >50; jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, visual changes; elevated ESR/CRP; temporal artery tenderness | ESR, CRP (markedly elevated); temporal artery biopsy; temporal artery ultrasound (halo sign) |

## NOTES

- ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria require all of the following: (1) unilateral or bilateral pain in distribution of GON, LON, or TON; (2) pain has two of three: recurring paroxysmal attacks lasting seconds to minutes, severe intensity, shooting/stabbing/sharp quality; (3) tender to palpation over the affected nerve; (4) pain temporarily relieved by local anesthetic block
- The greater occipital nerve block is the cornerstone of both diagnosis and initial treatment; a positive response (>50% relief) is required for definitive ICHD-3 diagnosis
- GON landmark: palpate external occipital protuberance (EOP); the GON is approximately at the medial third of a line drawn from EOP to mastoid process; the occipital artery pulse may be used as an adjacent landmark
- Occipital neuralgia frequently coexists with migraine; treat both conditions when present
- Distinguish from cervicogenic headache: occipital neuralgia is neuralgic (paroxysmal, shooting), while cervicogenic headache is referred, dull, and provoked by neck movement
- Red flags requiring urgent imaging: sudden onset, fever, weight loss, neurologic deficits, history of cancer, anticoagulation, trauma, age >50 with new headache
- Avoid overuse of nerve blocks with steroid (limit 3-4 per year) due to risk of local tissue atrophy and systemic steroid effects
- When starting carbamazepine, screen for HLA-B*1502 in patients of Asian descent (risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome / toxic epidermal necrolysis)
- Pulsed radiofrequency (42 degrees C) is preferred over conventional thermal radiofrequency (80 degrees C) for occipital nerves to avoid deafferentation pain and permanent numbness
- Occipital nerve stimulation should be reserved for truly refractory patients after multidisciplinary evaluation including psychological assessment
