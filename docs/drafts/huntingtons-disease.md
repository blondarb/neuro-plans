# Huntington's Disease

**DIAGNOSIS:** Huntington's Disease
**ICD-10:** G10 (Huntington disease)
**SCOPE:** Diagnosis confirmation via genetic testing, chorea management, psychiatric symptom treatment, cognitive decline management, dysphagia assessment, genetic counseling, and end-of-life planning. Focuses primarily on outpatient management. Excludes Huntington disease-like syndromes (HDL1-4) and other chorea etiologies.

**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

| Stage 5 (Advanced) | 0 | Total dependence; requires full care | Total care; nursing facility or hospice |

---

## APPENDIX B: Genetic Counseling Considerations

### Pre-Test Counseling Essentials

1. **Implications of positive result:** Progressive, fatal disease with no cure; 50% risk to offspring
2. **Implications of negative result:** No increased risk, but survivor guilt possible
3. **Intermediate alleles (27-35 repeats):** Not affected, but may expand in offspring
4. **Reduced penetrance (36-39 repeats):** May or may not develop HD; difficult counseling
5. **Full penetrance (40+ repeats):** Will develop HD if lives long enough
6. **Insurance and discrimination:** GINA protects health insurance and employment; does NOT cover life, disability, or long-term care insurance
7. **Timeline:** Results typically 2-4 weeks; follow-up support essential

### Testing of At-Risk Individuals

- Minimum age 18 for predictive testing (legal adult)
- Do not test minors unless symptomatic
- Recommended: 2+ counseling sessions before testing
- Wait period between disclosure and decision
- Support system should be in place before results

### Prenatal Testing Options

1. **Prenatal diagnosis:** CVS at 10-12 weeks or amniocentesis at 15-20 weeks
2. **Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT):** IVF with embryo selection
3. **Non-disclosure testing:** Pregnancy terminated if affected without revealing parent's status
4. **Exclusion testing:** Determines if fetus inherited grandparent's chromosome without revealing parent's status

| Issue | Considerations |
|-------|----------------|
| Feeding tubes | PEG may prolong survival but not necessarily quality of life; discuss before capacity lost |
| Mechanical ventilation | Usually not consistent with comfort goals in end-stage HD |
| Antibiotic use | Consider limiting to comfort measures in advanced disease |
| Hospitalization | May prefer comfort care at home or hospice facility |
| Autopsy/brain donation | Important for research; discuss while patient can consent |
