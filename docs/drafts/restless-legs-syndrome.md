# Restless Legs Syndrome

**DIAGNOSIS:** Restless Legs Syndrome (Willis-Ekbom Disease)
**ICD-10:** G25.81 (Restless legs syndrome)
**SCOPE:** Diagnosis confirmation using IRLSSG criteria, workup for secondary causes, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic management, and augmentation prevention/treatment. Primarily outpatient management with limited ED/HOSP coverage for severe refractory cases.

**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

---

## IRLSSG Diagnostic Criteria (All 5 Required)

1. **Urge to move the legs** usually accompanied by uncomfortable sensations
2. **Symptoms begin or worsen during rest or inactivity** (lying, sitting)
3. **Symptoms are partially or totally relieved by movement** (walking, stretching)
4. **Symptoms occur exclusively or predominantly in the evening or night** (circadian pattern)
5. **Symptoms are not solely accounted for by another condition** (leg cramps, positional discomfort, myalgia, venous stasis, leg edema, arthritis, habitual foot tapping)

**Supportive Features:** Family history (40-60%); response to dopaminergic therapy; periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS) on polysomnography

## Medications to AVOID in RLS

| Medication Class | Examples | Effect on RLS |
|------------------|----------|---------------|
| Antihistamines (first-generation) | Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), hydroxyzine, promethazine, chlorpheniramine | Significantly worsen RLS; block dopamine |
| Antidopaminergic antiemetics | Metoclopramide (Reglan), prochlorperazine (Compazine) | Strong RLS exacerbation; block dopamine |
| Typical antipsychotics | Haloperidol, chlorpromazine | Severe RLS worsening; dopamine blockade |
| Atypical antipsychotics | Olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone | Can worsen RLS; less than typicals |
| SSRIs | Sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram | May worsen RLS in 10-20% of patients |
| SNRIs | Venlafaxine, duloxetine | Similar to SSRIs; variable effect |
| TCAs | Amitriptyline, nortriptyline | Can worsen RLS; antihistaminic effects |
| Lithium | Lithium carbonate | May exacerbate RLS |
| Sedating antihistamines in OTC sleep aids | ZzzQuil, Tylenol PM, Advil PM | Major RLS trigger |

**Safer alternatives when possible:**
- For allergies: Non-sedating antihistamines (cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine)
- For nausea: Ondansetron, ginger
- For depression: Bupropion (least likely to worsen), mirtazapine may be neutral
- For sleep: Trazodone, melatonin, alpha-2-delta ligands

## APPENDIX A: Augmentation Recognition and Management Algorithm

**Signs of Augmentation (EURLSSG Criteria):**
1. Symptoms occur 2+ hours earlier than before treatment
2. Symptoms are more intense than before treatment started
3. Symptoms spread to previously unaffected body parts (arms, trunk)
4. Shorter latency to symptoms at rest
5. Shorter duration of medication effect
6. Periodic limb movements worsen during wakefulness

**Management Steps:**
1. Confirm augmentation (not tolerance, progression, or noncompliance)
2. Check and optimize iron stores (ferritin >100 ng/mL)
3. Reduce dopamine agonist dose by 25-50%
4. If augmentation persists: taper and discontinue dopamine agonist over 2-4 weeks
5. Bridge with alpha-2-delta ligand or low-dose opioid
6. Expect 1-2 weeks of symptom worsening during washout
7. Transition to non-dopaminergic maintenance (alpha-2-delta preferred)
8. If severe: may need temporary opioid bridge during transition

**Prevention:**
- Use lowest effective dopamine agonist dose
- Prefer alpha-2-delta ligands as first-line
- Monitor iron status and supplement to keep ferritin >75-100
- Avoid early dose escalation of dopamine agonists

## APPENDIX B: RLS in Special Populations

### Pregnancy
- RLS affects up to 25% of pregnant women, especially 3rd trimester
- Usually resolves within weeks postpartum
- Treatment options limited:
  - First-line: Iron supplementation (safe in pregnancy)
  - Non-pharmacologic measures
  - Clonazepam (pregnancy category D - avoid if possible)
  - Alpha-2-delta ligands not well-studied in pregnancy
  - Dopamine agonists: limited data, generally avoided

### Chronic Kidney Disease
- RLS prevalence 20-40% in dialysis patients
- Iron deficiency common; IV iron often needed
- Dose adjust gabapentin/pregabalin for renal function
- Dopamine agonists can be used (less augmentation concern in this population)
- May improve after renal transplant

### Pediatric RLS
- Often misdiagnosed as "growing pains" or ADHD
- Strong genetic component; family history important
- Iron deficiency common; check ferritin (target >50)
- Non-pharmacologic first; limited pediatric drug data
- Gabapentin most commonly used off-label

### Parkinson's Disease Coexistence
- RLS can coexist with Parkinson's disease
- May be difficult to distinguish from Parkinson's symptoms
- Parkinson's medications may treat or worsen RLS
- DaTscan can help differentiate if unclear
