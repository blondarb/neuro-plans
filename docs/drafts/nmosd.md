# Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)

**VERSION:** 1.2
**CREATED:** January 30, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)

**ICD-10:** G36.0 (Neuromyelitis optica [Devic]), G36.9 (Acute disseminated demyelination, unspecified)

**SYNONYMS:** Neuromyelitis optica, NMO, Devic disease, Devic syndrome, NMOSD, NMO spectrum disorder, aquaporin-4 antibody disease, AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD, AQP4-IgG seronegative NMOSD, opticospinal MS, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, LETM

**SCOPE:** Diagnostic workup, acute attack management, and long-term disease-modifying therapy for NMOSD. Covers AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative NMOSD, acute optic neuritis, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), area postrema syndrome, acute brainstem syndrome, symptomatic narcolepsy, and acute cerebral syndrome. Includes relapse treatment, attack prevention, and supportive care. For isolated optic neuritis without NMOSD features, see "Optic Neuritis" template. For MS, see "MS - New Diagnosis" and "MS - Chronic Management" templates. For MOG antibody disease (MOGAD), a distinct entity, specific MOGAD guidance is noted where management differs.

*Note: AQP4-IgG cell-based assay (CBA) is the gold standard -- avoid ELISA-only testing (lower sensitivity). If initial serum AQP4 is negative but clinical suspicion high, repeat during relapse (sensitivity increases during attacks) and send CSF. MOG-IgG must also use CBA. AQP4 and MOG are mutually exclusive -- double-positive results should be questioned and retested. Autoimmune comorbidities (SLE, Sjogren, myasthenia gravis) occur in ~25% of AQP4+ NMOSD patients.*

## 3. TREATMENT

### 3A. Acute Attack/Relapse Treatment

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Methylprednisolone IV | IV | Acute NMOSD relapse (optic neuritis, myelitis, area postrema syndrome) | 1000 mg daily x 5 days :: IV :: daily :: 1000 mg IV daily for 5 days; infuse over 1-2 hours; follow with oral prednisone taper | Active untreated infection; uncontrolled diabetes; psychosis from steroids | Glucose q6h (target <180); BP; mood/sleep; GI prophylaxis | URGENT | STAT | - | STAT |

| Oral prednisone taper (after IV steroids) | PO | Transition from IV steroids; prevent rebound relapse | 60 mg :: PO :: daily :: Prednisone taper over 4-6 weeks: 60 mg x 1 wk; 40 mg x 1 wk; 20 mg x 1 wk; 10 mg x 1 wk; longer taper if severe attack or slow recovery | Active infection; poorly controlled diabetes | Glucose; BP; mood; weight; bone density if prolonged | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Plasmapheresis (PLEX) | - | Severe attack; incomplete response to steroids after 3-5 days; rescue therapy | 5-7 exchanges over 10-14 days :: - :: - :: 1-1.5 plasma volumes per exchange; albumin replacement; start within 5 days of steroid failure for best results | Hemodynamic instability; sepsis; coagulopathy; poor vascular access | BP during exchanges; electrolytes (Ca, K, Mg); fibrinogen; coagulation; line site | - | STAT | - | STAT |
| IVIG (if PLEX unavailable or contraindicated) | IV | Alternative rescue therapy when PLEX unavailable | 0.4 g/kg :: IV :: daily x 5 days :: 0.4 g/kg/day IV x 5 days (total 2 g/kg); infuse per weight-based protocol | IgA deficiency (anaphylaxis risk); recent thromboembolic event; renal failure | Renal function daily; headache; thrombosis; volume overload; check IgA before first dose | - | URGENT | - | URGENT |

*Note: NMOSD relapses are typically more severe than MS relapses. Start IV methylprednisolone immediately upon suspicion of relapse. PLEX should be considered early (within days, not weeks) if steroids are insufficient -- studies show better outcomes with early PLEX. Unlike MS, NMOSD relapses cause cumulative disability with incomplete recovery, so aggressive acute treatment is critical.*

*Note: FDA-approved treatments for AQP4+ NMOSD: eculizumab (2019), inebilizumab (2020), satralizumab (2020), ravulizumab (2024). These are preferred for AQP4+ patients. For AQP4-seronegative NMOSD, rituximab, mycophenolate, or azathioprine are commonly used (no FDA-approved options). Do NOT use MS disease-modifying therapies (interferon-beta, fingolimod, natalizumab, alemtuzumab) in NMOSD -- these may worsen disease. CRITICAL: meningococcal vaccination is REQUIRED before eculizumab/ravulizumab (complement inhibitors increase meningococcal infection risk).*

### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Return to ED immediately for new or worsening vision loss, numbness/weakness, urinary retention, or intractable vomiting (may indicate relapse requiring urgent treatment) | Y | Y | Y |
| NMOSD is a lifelong condition requiring continuous preventive therapy -- stopping treatment significantly increases relapse risk and disability | Y | Y | Y |
| Do NOT use MS-specific medications (interferons, fingolimod, natalizumab) as these may worsen NMOSD | - | Y | Y |
| Report any fever, cough, or signs of infection immediately while on immunotherapy (infection risk is increased) | - | Y | Y |
| Avoid live vaccines while on immunosuppressive therapy; inform all physicians of immunosuppression status | - | Y | Y |
| Keep all infusion appointments; missed doses increase relapse risk | - | Y | Y |
| Pregnancy must be discussed with neurology BEFORE conception as most NMOSD treatments are teratogenic; planned pregnancy requires treatment coordination | - | Y | Y |
| Carry medical alert identification indicating NMOSD diagnosis and immunosuppressive medications | - | Y | Y |

## CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT NOTES

### 2015 IPND Diagnostic Criteria for NMOSD

**AQP4-IgG Seropositive:**
1. At least 1 core clinical characteristic
2. Positive AQP4-IgG (CBA preferred)
3. Exclusion of alternative diagnoses

**AQP4-IgG Seronegative (or Unknown):**
1. At least 2 core clinical characteristics from separate attacks, at least 1 of which is optic neuritis, LETM, or area postrema syndrome
2. Dissemination in space
3. Additional MRI requirements met
4. Negative AQP4-IgG or unknown status
5. Exclusion of alternative diagnoses

### Core Clinical Characteristics

1. **Optic neuritis** -- unilateral or bilateral; may be severe with poor recovery
2. **Acute myelitis** -- usually LETM (≥3 segments); central cord involvement
3. **Area postrema syndrome** -- intractable hiccups or nausea/vomiting lasting >48h
4. **Acute brainstem syndrome** -- periependymal brainstem lesion
5. **Symptomatic narcolepsy/hypothalamic syndrome** -- diencephalic lesion
6. **Acute cerebral syndrome** -- large hemispheric white matter lesion

### Red Flags: NMOSD vs MS

| Feature | Favors NMOSD | Favors MS |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Optic neuritis severity | Severe; bilateral; poor recovery | Mild-moderate; unilateral; good recovery |
| Cord lesions | LETM (≥3 segments); central cord | Short (<3 segments); peripheral |
| Brain MRI | Few lesions; periependymal; area postrema | Dawson fingers; periventricular; juxtacortical |
| OCBs | Usually absent (~15-20%) | Usually present (~85%) |
| Recovery from relapses | Often incomplete; cumulative disability | Usually good; less residual disability |
| Progression | Relapse-driven only (no SPMS) | May develop SPMS |
| Demographics | Female predominance (9:1); non-White | Female predominance (3:1); White |
| AQP4-IgG | Positive (~75%) | Negative |
| Response to MS DMTs | May worsen | Effective |

### CRITICAL: Do NOT Use MS DMTs in NMOSD

The following MS medications may worsen NMOSD and are CONTRAINDICATED:
- Interferon-beta (Avonex, Rebif, Betaseron, Plegridy)
- Fingolimod (Gilenya) and other S1P receptor modulators
- Natalizumab (Tysabri)
- Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada)
