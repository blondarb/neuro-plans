# Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN)

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** February 11, 2026
**REVISED:** February 11, 2026
**STATUS:** Revised per checker validation

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN)

**ICD-10:** G61.82 (Multifocal motor neuropathy)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC), 80053 (CMP), 82784 (Immunoglobulins quantitative), 86255 (GM1 antibodies), 95907-95913 (NCS), 95860-95870 (EMG), 70553 (MRI brain), 72141-72158 (MRI spine), 89050 (CSF analysis), 86021 (ANCA screen), 84443 (TSH)

**SYNONYMS:** multifocal motor neuropathy, MMN, multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block, MMNCB, Lewis-Sumner syndrome variant, immune-mediated motor neuropathy, multifocal acquired motor axonopathy

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis and management of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) in adults. Includes diagnostic criteria (EFNS/PNS), electrodiagnostic findings including motor conduction block, anti-GM1 antibody testing, and IVIg therapy. Covers differential diagnosis with ALS (critical mimic), CIDP, and other motor neuron/neuropathy disorders. Excludes Lewis-Sumner syndrome (multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy — MADSAM) as separate entity but includes in differential.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN):** Chronic immune-mediated neuropathy characterized by progressive, asymmetric, predominantly distal upper limb weakness without sensory loss
- **Conduction block (definite):** ≥50% reduction in proximal vs distal CMAP amplitude/area across a non-entrapment nerve segment, with <30% temporal dispersion
- **Anti-GM1 IgM antibodies:** Present in ~50% of MMN; directed against GM1 ganglioside on motor nerves; high titers support diagnosis but absence does not exclude it
- **EFNS/PNS criteria:** Definite MMN requires clinical features (asymmetric limb weakness, motor predominant, ≥2 nerves) plus definite conduction block in ≥2 nerves

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

**Corticosteroids (prednisone, methylprednisolone): CONTRAINDICATED in MMN** — Steroids may WORSEN MMN and are NOT effective. This is a key distinguishing feature from CIDP.

**Plasma exchange (PLEX): CONTRAINDICATED/INEFFECTIVE in MMN** — PLEX does not improve and may worsen MMN. Another key difference from CIDP and GBS.

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) | CRITICAL mimic; upper AND lower motor neuron signs; fasciculations prominent; bulbar involvement; progressive; no conduction block on NCS; normal sensory exams | NCS (no conduction block in ALS); EMG (widespread denervation/reinnervation in non-myotomal distribution); anti-GM1 negative; upper motor neuron signs on exam |
| CIDP (chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy) | Symmetric, proximal and distal weakness; SENSORY loss present; elevated CSF protein; diffuse demyelination on NCS without focal conduction block; responds to steroids AND PLEX | NCS (diffuse demyelinating pattern vs focal conduction block); sensory loss on exam; CSF protein elevated; response to steroids (CIDP yes, MMN NO) |
| Lewis-Sumner syndrome (MADSAM) | Multifocal demyelinating neuropathy but WITH sensory involvement; conduction block present; responds to IVIg AND steroids | NCS (conduction block with sensory abnormalities); clinical exam shows sensory loss; steroid-responsive |
| Inclusion body myositis (IBM) | Finger flexor and quadriceps weakness may mimic MMN; but weakness is proximal pattern; CK more elevated; muscle biopsy diagnostic | CK (more elevated in IBM); NCS (myopathic not neuropathic); EMG (myopathic units); muscle biopsy (rimmed vacuoles, inclusion bodies) |
| Hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) | Slowly progressive distal motor neuropathy; family history; no conduction block; onset typically younger | Genetic testing (HSPB1, HSPB8, GARS, DYNC1H1); NCS (axonal without conduction block); family history |
| Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) | Progressive symmetric proximal weakness; lower motor neuron; no conduction block; genetic diagnosis | SMN1 gene deletion testing; NCS (no conduction block); EMG (chronic neurogenic pattern); symmetric weakness |
| Cervical radiculopathy (multilevel) | Asymmetric upper limb weakness; but follows root distribution; sensory loss in dermatomes; neck pain; imaging abnormalities | MRI cervical spine (disc herniation, foraminal stenosis); NCS/EMG (root distribution not individual nerve territories) |
| Monomelic amyotrophy (Hirayama disease) | Unilateral distal upper limb wasting; young males; non-progressive after initial phase; no conduction block | MRI cervical spine (forward displacement of posterior dura in flexion); NCS/EMG (limited to one limb); clinical stabilization |

## NOTES

- MMN is a treatable mimic of ALS — correct diagnosis is critical as prognosis and treatment differ dramatically
- Key clinical features: asymmetric, predominantly DISTAL, predominantly UPPER LIMB weakness; NO sensory loss; NO upper motor neuron signs
- Conduction block is the electrodiagnostic hallmark — must stimulate proximal nerve segments (Erb's point, axilla) to detect it; standard NCS may miss it
- Anti-GM1 IgM antibodies are present in ~50% (range 30-80%) — absence does NOT exclude MMN
- IVIg is the ONLY proven effective therapy; most patients require lifelong maintenance treatment
- STEROIDS DO NOT WORK and may WORSEN MMN — this is a critical clinical pearl distinguishing MMN from CIDP
- PLASMA EXCHANGE DOES NOT WORK for MMN — another key distinction from CIDP and GBS
- SCIg is a convenient alternative to IVIg for maintenance, allowing self-administration at home with fewer systemic side effects
- Progressive axonal loss occurs even with IVIg treatment but is slower than without treatment; early initiation is important
- CK may be mildly elevated (1-3x ULN) in MMN — do not misinterpret as myopathy
- CSF protein is typically NORMAL in MMN (unlike CIDP where it is elevated) — useful diagnostic distinction
