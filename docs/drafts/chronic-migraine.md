# Chronic Migraine

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 30, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Chronic Migraine

**ICD-10:** G43.709 (Chronic migraine without aura, not intractable), G43.719 (Chronic migraine without aura, intractable), G43.701 (Chronic migraine without aura, not intractable, with status migrainosus), G43.711 (Chronic migraine without aura, intractable, with status migrainosus), G43.909 (Migraine, unspecified, not intractable), G44.40 (Drug-induced headache, not elsewhere classified, not intractable)

**CPT CODES:** 99213-99215 (Office visit), 64405 (Greater occipital nerve block), 64615 (OnabotulinumtoxinA injection for chronic migraine), 96372 (Therapeutic injection, SC/IM), 96365 (IV infusion, initial), 70553 (MRI brain with and without contrast), 70551 (MRI brain without contrast)

**SYNONYMS:** Chronic migraine, CM, transformed migraine, chronic daily headache due to migraine, chronic migraine headache, intractable migraine, refractory migraine, chronic migraine without aura, chronic migraine with aura, medication overuse migraine, transformed migraine headache, CDH, chronic daily headache, high-frequency episodic migraine, frequent migraine, daily migraine, persistent migraine, treatment-resistant migraine, difficult-to-treat migraine, CGRP-responsive migraine, botox migraine, preventive migraine management

**SCOPE:** Comprehensive evaluation and management of chronic migraine in adults (defined as ≥15 headache days/month for >3 months, with migraine features on ≥8 days/month per ICHD-3). Covers preventive pharmacotherapy (oral agents, CGRP monoclonal antibodies, oral CGRP antagonists, onabotulinumtoxinA), acute treatment optimization, medication overuse headache screening and management, comorbidity assessment, and non-pharmacologic interventions. Primary focus on outpatient preventive management with acute/inpatient protocols for status migrainosus and refractory attacks. Excludes episodic migraine with <15 headache days/month (see Migraine template), cluster headache, and other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Chronic Migraine (ICHD-3):** Headache occurring on ≥15 days/month for >3 months, with migraine features on ≥8 days/month
- **Episodic Migraine:** <15 headache days per month
- **Medication Overuse Headache (MOH):** Headache ≥15 days/month with regular overuse of acute medications for >3 months (triptans/opioids/combination analgesics ≥10 days/month; simple analgesics ≥15 days/month)
- **Status Migrainosus:** Debilitating migraine attack lasting >72 hours
- **Refractory Chronic Migraine:** Chronic migraine that fails to respond to adequate trials of preventive therapies from at least 2 different pharmacologic classes
- **High-Frequency Episodic Migraine (HFEM):** 8-14 headache days/month; at high risk for transformation to chronic migraine

---

**DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (ICHD-3 1.3):**

**A.** Headache (migraine-like or tension-type-like) on ≥15 days/month for >3 months, fulfilling criteria B and C
**B.** Occurring in a patient who has had at least 5 attacks fulfilling criteria B-D for migraine without aura and/or criteria B and C for migraine with aura
**C.** On ≥8 days/month for >3 months, fulfilling any of the following:
  1. Criteria C and D for migraine without aura
  2. Criteria B and C for migraine with aura
  3. Believed by the patient to be migraine at onset and relieved by a triptan or ergot derivative
**D.** Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis

**Note:** Chronic migraine with medication overuse should be coded with both G43.7xx AND G44.4x per ICHD-3 recommendations.

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Medication overuse headache (MOH) | Chronic daily headache with frequent acute medication use (≥10-15 days/month); may coexist with chronic migraine | Medication diary; detoxification trial; headache frequency may improve with withdrawal |
| Chronic tension-type headache | Bilateral, pressing/tightening, mild-moderate intensity; NO nausea/vomiting; no more than one of photo/phonophobia | Clinical history; typically lacks migraine features |
| New daily persistent headache (NDPH) | Distinct remembered onset date; daily and unremitting from onset; no prior chronic headache | Clinical history; MRI brain; may need LP |
| Hemicrania continua | Continuous strictly unilateral headache with autonomic features; responds absolutely to indomethacin | Indomethacin trial (complete response diagnostic) |
| Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) | Papilledema, visual obscurations, pulsatile tinnitus; worse with Valsalva; typically young obese females | Fundoscopy, LP with elevated OP (>25 cm H2O), MRI/MRV |
| Cerebral venous thrombosis | Progressive headache, seizures, focal deficits; risk factors (OCP, pregnancy, coagulopathy) | MRV/CTV; D-dimer |
| Giant cell arteritis | Age >50, new headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, visual symptoms, elevated inflammatory markers | ESR/CRP, temporal artery biopsy |
| Intracranial neoplasm | Progressive headache worse in morning/with Valsalva; focal neurologic deficits; seizures | MRI brain with contrast |
| Low CSF pressure headache (SIH) | Orthostatic headache (worse upright, better supine); may have subdural collections | MRI brain (pachymeningeal enhancement, brain sagging); LP with low OP |
| Cervicogenic headache | Unilateral, starts in neck/occipital region; triggered by neck movement/posture; reduced cervical ROM | Cervical exam, cervical imaging; diagnostic nerve block |

## CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT NOTES

- Chronic migraine is defined as ≥15 headache days/month for >3 months with migraine features on ≥8 days; differentiate from episodic migraine (<15 days/month)
- Up to 50-80% of chronic migraine patients have comorbid medication overuse headache (MOH); ALWAYS screen for acute medication frequency
- Patients with MOH may need detoxification before or concurrent with preventive initiation; some preventives (e.g., topiramate, CGRP mAbs) may work even with ongoing overuse
- CGRP-targeted therapies (mAbs and oral gepants) represent a paradigm shift: mechanism-specific, well-tolerated, may be used first-line in appropriate patients
- OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) is ONLY approved for chronic migraine (≥15 days/month), NOT episodic migraine; requires minimum 2 treatment cycles before assessing efficacy
- Atogepant (Qulipta) is the only oral CGRP antagonist (gepant) with specific FDA approval for chronic migraine prevention (60 mg daily)
- Rimegepant offers dual-use: 75 mg every other day for prevention AND 75 mg as needed for acute treatment
- Oral preventives should be titrated slowly and given 2-3 months at target dose before declaring failure; most patients need trials of multiple agents
- Combination preventive therapy may be necessary for refractory patients (e.g., oral agent + CGRP mAb + Botox)
- Non-pharmacologic approaches (CBT, biofeedback, exercise, stress management) are evidence-based and should be recommended to ALL patients
- Neuromodulation devices (Cefaly, gammaCore, SpringTMS, Nerivio) are FDA-cleared options with favorable safety profiles
- Address comorbidities: depression (50%), anxiety (50%), sleep disorders (40%), obesity - treatment of comorbidities may improve headache
- Pregnancy planning requires careful medication review: discontinue teratogens (topiramate, valproate), gepants; CGRP mAbs should be stopped (limited safety data); consider nerve blocks, magnesium, biofeedback
- Goal of treatment: reduce headache frequency by ≥50%, reduce disability (MIDAS/HIT-6), optimize acute treatment, minimize medication overuse, improve quality of life
