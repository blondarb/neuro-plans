## KEY DISTINGUISHING FEATURES BY ETIOLOGY

| Etiology | Onset | Pain | Distribution | Key Features | Diagnostic Clues |
|----------|-------|------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Parsonage-Turner (neuralgic amyotrophy)** | Acute (hours to days) | Severe, precedes weakness by days-weeks | Patchy, non-anatomic trunk/cord distribution; often upper trunk | Preceded by illness/surgery/vaccination; self-limited but slow recovery (months-years) | EMG: patchy denervation; MRI: muscle denervation edema; serum anti-LRP4 rarely positive |
| **Traumatic** | Acute (immediate) | Variable | Correlates with mechanism (traction, penetrating) | Motorcycle accidents, falls, shoulder dislocations | EMG at 3-4 weeks; CT angiography for vascular injury; MR neurography for nerve continuity |
| **Radiation-induced** | Insidious (months-years post-RT) | Usually painless; paresthesias early | Upper trunk brachial (breast/lung RT); lumbosacral (pelvic RT) | Latency 6 months-20+ years post-radiation; dose >60 Gy higher risk; myokymia on EMG | EMG: myokymic discharges pathognomonic; MRI: diffuse T2 signal without mass |
| **Neoplastic** | Subacute-chronic (weeks-months) | Often severe, progressive | Lower trunk brachial (Pancoast); lumbosacral (pelvic tumors) | Weight loss; progressive course; Horner syndrome (lower trunk); palpable mass | MRI with contrast: enhancing mass; PET-CT; biopsy may be needed |
| **Diabetic amyotrophy (DLRPN)** | Subacute (weeks) | Severe thigh/hip pain | Proximal > distal; often starts unilateral then bilateral | Weight loss; T2DM (may be well-controlled); CSF protein elevated | EMG: lumbosacral plexopathy; nerve biopsy: microvasculitis; MRI: nerve/muscle enhancement |
| **Compressive/Entrapment** | Gradual or postoperative | Positional; may be painless | Relates to anatomic compression site | Post-surgical (lithotomy, retractors); hematoma; aneurysm | CT/MRI: structural lesion; EMG confirms localization |

## APPENDIX A: IMAGING DECISION ALGORITHM

### When to Image the Plexus

**Immediate MRI Plexus with Contrast (STAT):**
- Suspected neoplastic plexopathy (progressive weakness, weight loss, known cancer history)
- Horner syndrome with brachial plexopathy (Pancoast tumor)
- Post-traumatic plexopathy with suspected vascular injury
- Rapidly progressive weakness without clear etiology
- Suspected retroperitoneal hematoma (add CT abdomen/pelvis)

**Urgent MRI Plexus (within 1-2 weeks):**
- Acute plexopathy with significant motor deficit
- Clinical diagnosis of neuralgic amyotrophy (confirm with imaging; rule out structural cause)
- Diabetic amyotrophy (assess for nerve enhancement, exclude mass)
- Post-radiation patient with new plexopathy symptoms

**Routine MRI Plexus (within 4-6 weeks):**
- Subacute plexopathy with stable deficits undergoing EMG evaluation
- Chronic plexopathy for baseline documentation
- Pre-surgical planning for nerve reconstruction

**No MRI Needed:**
- Classic Parsonage-Turner presentation with typical EMG findings and improving course
- Mild sensory-only symptoms with clear positional/compressive etiology resolving with conservative care

### CT Indications
- **STAT CT abdomen/pelvis:** Suspected retroperitoneal hematoma (anticoagulated patient + lumbosacral plexopathy)
- **CT chest with contrast:** Suspected Pancoast tumor
- **CT angiography:** Traumatic plexopathy with suspected vascular injury

---

## APPENDIX B: EMG/NCS INTERPRETATION IN PLEXOPATHY

### Key Electrodiagnostic Findings

| Finding | Interpretation | Differential Consideration |
|---------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Reduced SNAP amplitudes** in plexus distribution | Post-ganglionic lesion (plexopathy) | Distinguishes from radiculopathy (SNAPs preserved in radiculopathy because lesion is pre-ganglionic) |
| **Denervation in multiple nerves** from same plexus | Confirms plexopathy (not single nerve or root) | Multiple roots/trunks/cords involved differentiates from radiculopathy or mononeuropathy |
| **Myokymic discharges** | Highly suggestive of radiation plexopathy | Nearly pathognomonic for radiation injury; absent in neoplastic plexopathy |
| **Conduction block** at plexus level | Demyelinating component; compression; tumor encasement | Consider compressive etiology; CIDP affecting plexus |
| **Fibrillation potentials + positive sharp waves** | Active denervation | Seen in all axonal plexopathies 2-3 weeks after onset |
| **Reduced recruitment without fibrillations** (early) | Recent injury (<2-3 weeks) or conduction block | Re-study at 3-4 weeks if initial study early |
| **Nascent motor unit potentials** | Early reinnervation (positive prognostic sign) | Earliest sign of recovery; may appear 2-4 months after injury |

### Timing of EMG Studies
- **Baseline:** May be performed early for urgent clinical questions but fibrillations not yet present
- **Optimal initial study:** 3-4 weeks after symptom onset (allows fibrillation potentials to develop)
- **Follow-up study:** 3-6 months to assess reinnervation
- **Pre-surgical study:** Before nerve repair/transfer to confirm viable targets

---

## APPENDIX C: REHABILITATION APPROACH

### Phase 1: Acute (Week 1-4)
- Pain management optimization
- Gentle passive range of motion to prevent contractures
- Shoulder/hip positioning and protection
- Edema management
- Splinting as needed (wrist drop, foot drop)

### Phase 2: Active Assisted (Week 4-12)
- Active assisted range of motion as pain allows
- Isometric strengthening of intact muscles
- Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to denervated muscles (controversial; prevents atrophy)
- Sensory re-education
- Adaptive equipment training (OT)

### Phase 3: Strengthening (Month 3-12)
- Progressive resistive exercises as reinnervation occurs
- Functional task training
- Work conditioning and ergonomic modifications
- Ongoing pain management
- Serial clinical and EMG monitoring to guide exercise progression

### Phase 4: Maintenance (Ongoing)
- Independent home exercise program
- Continued adaptive strategies if residual deficit
- Vocational rehabilitation if unable to return to prior work
- Psychological support for chronic pain and disability
- Annual neurology follow-up for monitoring
