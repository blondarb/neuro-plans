## APPENDIX A: MCI Subtypes and Prognosis

### Classification

| Subtype | Characteristics | Progression Risk |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Amnestic MCI - Single Domain** | Memory impairment only; preserved other domains | Higher risk for Alzheimer's disease |
| **Amnestic MCI - Multi-Domain** | Memory + other cognitive domains impaired | Higher risk for AD or vascular dementia |
| **Non-Amnestic MCI - Single Domain** | Impairment in one non-memory domain (executive, language, visuospatial) | May progress to FTD, DLB, or vascular dementia |
| **Non-Amnestic MCI - Multi-Domain** | Multiple non-memory domains impaired | Variable; may progress to non-AD dementias |

### Biomarker-Based Staging (NIA-AA Research Framework)

| Stage | Clinical | Amyloid | Tau | Neurodegeneration |
|-------|----------|---------|-----|-------------------|
| **A-/T-/N-** | Cognitively normal | - | - | - |
| **A+/T-/N-** | Preclinical AD | + | - | - |
| **A+/T+/N-** | Preclinical AD | + | + | - |
| **A+/T+/N+** | MCI or Dementia due to AD | + | + | + |

*A = Amyloid, T = Tau, N = Neurodegeneration (atrophy, FDG-PET hypometabolism)*

### Progression Risk Factors

- **Higher risk:** Amnestic subtype, positive amyloid biomarkers, APOE4 carrier, greater hippocampal atrophy
- **Lower risk:** Negative amyloid biomarkers, identifiable reversible cause, younger age, non-amnestic subtype

## APPENDIX B: Anti-Amyloid Therapy Eligibility Checklist

### Lecanemab (Leqembi) Eligibility

**Inclusion Criteria:**
- [ ] MCI due to AD OR mild AD dementia
- [ ] Confirmed amyloid pathology (positive amyloid PET OR CSF Aβ42/40 ratio consistent with AD)
- [ ] MMSE typically 22-30 or MoCA 18-26
- [ ] Reliable caregiver/study partner

**Exclusion Criteria:**
- [ ] >4 microbleeds on MRI
- [ ] Any superficial siderosis
- [ ] Prior macrohemorrhage
- [ ] Current anticoagulation (relative; increases ARIA risk)
- [ ] Recent stroke or TIA (<12 months)

**Pre-Treatment Workup:**
- [ ] MRI brain within 1 year (assess for microbleeds, rule out other pathology)
- [ ] Amyloid PET or CSF biomarkers confirming amyloid positivity
- [ ] APOE genotyping (recommended for risk counseling)
- [ ] Baseline cognitive testing (MMSE, MoCA, or CDR)
- [ ] Informed consent including ARIA risk discussion

**Monitoring Schedule:**
- MRI: Baseline, Week 14, Week 52, Week 78 (and with new symptoms)
- Clinical assessment for ARIA symptoms each infusion

### ARIA Symptom Recognition

| ARIA-E (Edema) | ARIA-H (Hemorrhage) |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Headache | Often asymptomatic |
| Confusion/disorientation | Headache |
| Visual disturbances | Focal neurological symptoms |
| Nausea/vomiting | If large hemorrhage |
| Gait instability | |

*Most ARIA is asymptomatic and detected on scheduled MRI monitoring*
