# Ulnar Neuropathy

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** February 9, 2026
**REVISED:** February 9, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft — Awaiting physician review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Ulnar Neuropathy

**ICD-10:** G56.20 (Ulnar nerve lesion, unspecified upper limb), G56.21 (Ulnar nerve lesion, right upper limb), G56.22 (Ulnar nerve lesion, left upper limb), G56.23 (Ulnar nerve lesion, bilateral upper limbs)

**CPT CODES:** 95907 (Nerve conduction study, 1-2 nerves), 95908 (NCS, 3-4 nerves), 95909 (NCS, 5-6 nerves), 95886 (Needle EMG, each extremity), 73221 (MRI upper extremity without contrast), 73218 (MRI upper extremity without contrast — elbow), 76882 (Ultrasound, extremity, non-vascular), 64718 (Ulnar nerve transposition), 64719 (Ulnar nerve decompression), 85025 (CBC), 80048 (BMP), 82947 (Glucose), 84443 (TSH), 82728 (Ferritin)

**SYNONYMS:** Ulnar nerve entrapment, cubital tunnel syndrome, ulnar nerve lesion, ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE), ulnar nerve palsy, tardy ulnar palsy, Guyon canal syndrome, ulnar neuropathy at the wrist, handlebar palsy, cyclist's palsy, claw hand (late finding)

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of ulnar neuropathy from entrapment (cubital tunnel, Guyon canal) and other etiologies in adults. Includes electrodiagnostic workup, conservative management, surgical decision-making, and post-operative care. Covers ED evaluation for acute ulnar injury, inpatient perioperative management, and outpatient chronic management. Excludes brachial plexus injuries and cervical radiculopathy as primary diagnoses (addressed in differential).

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Cubital tunnel syndrome:** Ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow, the most common site of ulnar nerve compression; occurs at the retrocondylar groove or beneath the Osborne ligament (humeroulnar aponeurotic arcade)
- **Guyon canal syndrome:** Ulnar nerve entrapment at the wrist in Guyon canal; less common than cubital tunnel; subdivided by zone of compression (motor, sensory, or mixed)
- **Froment sign:** Flexion of the thumb IP joint during attempted lateral pinch, indicating adductor pollicis weakness (ulnar nerve dysfunction)
- **Wartenberg sign:** Inability to adduct the small finger (abducted posture at rest) due to weakness of the third palmar interosseous muscle
- **Claw hand deformity:** Hyperextension of MCP joints with flexion of PIP/DIP joints of digits 4-5 due to loss of ulnar-innervated intrinsic muscle function; paradoxically worse with distal lesions ("ulnar paradox")
- **Tinel sign:** Reproduction of paresthesias along the ulnar nerve distribution by tapping over the nerve at the site of entrapment

## 4. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS

### 4A. Referrals & Consults

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Neurology referral for electrodiagnostic testing (EMG/NCS) to confirm diagnosis, localize lesion, and quantify severity — essential before surgical decision-making | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Hand surgery or peripheral nerve surgery referral if moderate-severe ulnar neuropathy on EMG, progressive weakness, or failed 3 months conservative treatment | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

| Orthopedics if concurrent elbow pathology (arthritis, prior fracture malunion, cubitus valgus) contributing to nerve compression | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Avoid prolonged elbow flexion: do not rest chin on hand, hold phone to ear with affected arm, or sleep with elbows bent tightly — these positions stretch and compress the ulnar nerve | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Wear a night splint or wrap a towel around the elbow at bedtime to keep the elbow in a slightly extended position and prevent nocturnal compression | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid direct pressure on the inner elbow (funny bone area): do not lean on desks, armrests, or car door; use padded elbow sleeve if unavoidable | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Perform nerve gliding exercises 3 times daily as instructed by therapist to maintain nerve mobility and reduce adhesion at the entrapment site | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Report worsening hand weakness (dropping objects, difficulty turning keys, or loss of grip strength) — progressive motor loss may require surgical intervention | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| After surgery, follow splinting and range-of-motion protocols strictly; nerve recovery is slow (1 mm/day or ~1 inch/month) and full recovery may take 6-12 months | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Ergonomic workstation setup: keep elbows at 90 degrees or less when typing; use padded armrests; position keyboard so elbows are not fully flexed | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Cyclists: use padded gloves and change hand positions frequently to avoid Guyon canal compression (handlebar palsy) | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Manage contributing conditions: optimize diabetes control (HbA1c <7%), treat hypothyroidism, maintain healthy weight to reduce systemic nerve vulnerability | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid repetitive elbow flexion/extension activities or sustained gripping if they provoke symptoms; modify occupational tasks with OT guidance | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Post-surgical rehabilitation: follow graduated activity protocol; avoid heavy lifting (>10 lbs) for 6 weeks post-transposition; gradual return to full activity by 3 months | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

## NOTES

- Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (cubital tunnel syndrome) is the second most common entrapment neuropathy after carpal tunnel syndrome
- The ulnar nerve is most vulnerable at the elbow in the retrocondylar groove and beneath the Osborne ligament (humeroulnar aponeurotic arcade)
- Nocturnal symptoms are common because people naturally flex their elbows during sleep, compressing the ulnar nerve
- EMG/NCS should be performed before any surgical decision; a minimum of 3-4 weeks from symptom onset allows axonal changes to develop
- Ulnar nerve subluxation (nerve snaps over the medial epicondyle with flexion) can be identified clinically and by ultrasound — these patients may benefit from transposition rather than simple decompression
- The "ulnar paradox": distal lesions (Guyon canal) cause more severe claw hand than proximal lesions (cubital tunnel) because FDP function is preserved in distal lesions, allowing unopposed DIP flexion
- Froment sign (thumb IP flexion during lateral pinch) tests adductor pollicis (ulnar innervated) — compensation by FPL (median innervated)
- Recovery after surgery depends on severity: pure demyelinating (conduction slowing only) recovers faster than axonal loss; severe axonal degeneration may not fully recover
- Always check for "double crush" — concurrent cervical radiculopathy or thoracic outlet syndrome can predispose to distal ulnar entrapment
- Distinguish from ALS early: ALS has no sensory involvement, shows widespread denervation, and has upper motor neuron signs
