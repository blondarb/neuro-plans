### LUMBAR PUNCTURE

**Indication:** Diagnostic — ALL patients with suspected meningitis. LP is the definitive diagnostic procedure for viral meningitis. Do NOT delay empiric antibiotics/acyclovir while awaiting LP.

**Timing:** STAT in ED. If CT is needed first, give empiric antibiotics + acyclovir BEFORE CT, then LP after CT clears for safety.

**Volume Required:** 10-15 mL (4 tubes standard + extra for viral studies)

**Opening Pressure:** ALWAYS measure and document.

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Rationale | Target Finding |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|-----------|----------------|
| Opening pressure | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | STAT | Usually normal or mildly elevated in viral meningitis; markedly elevated suggests bacterial, fungal, or TB meningitis | Normal to mildly elevated (10-25 cm H2O); >30 cm H2O uncommon in viral — consider alternative diagnosis |
| Cell count with differential (tubes 1 AND 4) (CPT 89051) | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | STAT | HALLMARK: Lymphocytic pleocytosis; tube 1 vs 4 comparison differentiates traumatic tap; early viral meningitis (<48h) may show neutrophil predominance that shifts to lymphocytes on repeat LP | WBC 10-500 cells/uL with lymphocyte predominance (>50%); NOTE: early viral meningitis may have neutrophil predominance in first 24-48h |
| Protein (CPT 84157) | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | STAT | Mildly elevated in viral meningitis; markedly elevated (>200 mg/dL) suggests bacterial, TB, or fungal | Normal to mildly elevated (50-100 mg/dL); >200 mg/dL argues against simple viral meningitis |
| Glucose with paired serum glucose (CPT 82945) | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | STAT | NORMAL glucose is key differentiator from bacterial meningitis; CSF:serum ratio >0.6 expected in viral | Normal (>40 mg/dL; CSF:serum ratio >0.6); LOW glucose (<40 or ratio <0.4) argues strongly against viral — consider bacterial, TB, fungal, or carcinomatous meningitis |
| Gram stain (CPT 87205) | STAT | ROUTINE | - | STAT | Rule out bacterial meningitis; should be NEGATIVE in viral meningitis | No organisms seen (negative Gram stain expected) |
| Bacterial culture and sensitivity (CPT 87070) | STAT | ROUTINE | - | STAT | Gold standard to exclude bacterial meningitis; negative cultures at 48-72h help confirm viral etiology | No growth at 48-72h (expected in viral meningitis) |
| BioFire FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel (CPT 87483) | STAT | STAT | - | STAT | Rapid multiplex PCR (~1 hour turnaround); identifies 14 pathogens: 6 bacteria (E. coli K1, H. influenzae, L. monocytogenes, N. meningitidis, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae), 7 viruses (CMV, enterovirus, HSV-1, HSV-2, HHV-6, parechovirus, VZV), and Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii | Viral pathogen identified (most commonly enterovirus); negative for bacterial pathogens allows de-escalation of empiric antibiotics |
| Enterovirus PCR (CSF) (CPT 87498) | STAT | ROUTINE | - | STAT | Most common cause of viral meningitis (50-80% of identified cases); summer-fall seasonality; rapid confirmation allows discontinuation of empiric antibiotics and acyclovir | Positive in enteroviral meningitis; negative does not exclude viral etiology |
| HSV-1/2 PCR (CSF) (CPT 87529) | STAT | ROUTINE | - | STAT | CRITICAL: Exclude HSV encephalitis (treatable and fatal if missed); HSV-2 causes benign recurrent (Mollaret) meningitis | Negative (positive HSV-1 → treat as HSV encephalitis; positive HSV-2 → Mollaret meningitis, consider suppressive therapy) |
| VZV PCR (CSF) | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | URGENT | VZV meningitis can occur with or without rash (zoster sine herpete); immunocompromised patients at higher risk | Negative; if positive → IV acyclovir treatment indicated |
| CSF lactate | STAT | ROUTINE | - | STAT | CSF lactate <3.5 mmol/L strongly argues against bacterial meningitis (sensitivity ~93%, specificity ~96%); valuable when Gram stain negative and clinical picture unclear | <3.5 mmol/L (viral); >3.5 mmol/L (bacterial) |
| West Nile virus IgM (CSF) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | Summer-fall; mosquito exposure; elderly; flaccid paralysis; encephalitic features | Negative; if positive, confirms WNV neuroinvasive disease (supportive care) |
| Cryptococcal antigen (CSF) (CPT 87327) | - | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE | If immunocompromised (HIV, transplant); subacute or chronic meningitis | Negative |
| Cytology (CPT 88104) | - | ROUTINE | - | - | If malignancy in differential (subacute, cranial neuropathies, known cancer) | Negative for malignant cells |
| VDRL (CSF) (CPT 86592) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Neurosyphilis screen; lymphocytic CSF with normal glucose | Negative |
| AFB smear and culture (CPT 87116) | - | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE | If TB meningitis suspected (subacute presentation, basilar enhancement, low glucose, high protein, immigrant/HIV) | Negative |

**Special Handling:** BioFire ME Panel provides results in ~1 hour — prioritize this test for rapid de-escalation of empiric antibiotics. CSF viral cultures have low sensitivity and are NOT recommended as first-line. Save extra CSF (frozen at -80C) for additional testing if needed.

**Contraindications to LP (perform CT first):** Immunocompromised, known CNS mass, new seizure within 1 week, papilledema, GCS <10, focal neurologic deficit. Coagulopathy (INR >1.5, platelets <50K) — correct first if possible, but do NOT delay antibiotics.

## 3. TREATMENT

### CRITICAL: EMPIRIC THERAPY UNTIL BACTERIAL MENINGITIS EXCLUDED

**At initial presentation, viral and bacterial meningitis CANNOT be reliably distinguished clinically.** Empiric antibiotics and acyclovir MUST be started immediately and continued until CSF results (Gram stain, BioFire ME Panel, cultures, HSV PCR) exclude bacterial meningitis and HSV encephalitis. This typically takes 24-72 hours.

**De-escalation criteria:**
- BioFire ME Panel negative for bacteria + Gram stain negative + CSF profile consistent with viral (lymphocytic pleocytosis, normal glucose) → discontinue antibiotics
- HSV PCR negative + no encephalitic features + normal MRI → discontinue acyclovir
- Enterovirus PCR positive → confirms viral etiology, discontinue all empiric therapy

## APPENDIX A: CSF FINDINGS COMPARISON — VIRAL VS. BACTERIAL MENINGITIS

| Parameter | Viral Meningitis | Bacterial Meningitis | TB Meningitis | Fungal Meningitis |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| WBC (cells/uL) | 10-500 | 1,000-10,000 | 50-500 | 10-500 |
| Predominant cell | Lymphocytes (>50%) | Neutrophils (>80%) | Lymphocytes | Lymphocytes |
| Protein (mg/dL) | 50-100 (mild elevation) | 100-500 | 100-500 | 50-200 |
| Glucose (mg/dL) | Normal (>40) | Low (<40) | Low (<40) | Low (<40) |
| CSF:serum glucose | >0.6 | <0.4 | <0.4 | <0.4 |
| Opening pressure (cm H2O) | Normal to mildly elevated (10-25) | Elevated (20-50+) | Elevated (10-30) | Elevated (10-30) |
| Lactate (mmol/L) | <3.5 | >3.5 (usually >4.0) | >3.5 | Variable |
| Gram stain | Negative | Positive (60-90%) | AFB rarely positive | India ink (Crypto) |
| Procalcitonin (serum) | <0.5 ng/mL | >2.0 ng/mL | Variable | Variable |

**NOTE:** Early viral meningitis (first 24-48h) may show NEUTROPHILIC predominance (up to 60% of enteroviral cases). If clinical picture is ambiguous, repeat LP in 12-24h to demonstrate lymphocytic shift.

## APPENDIX B: COMMON CAUSES OF VIRAL MENINGITIS BY FREQUENCY

| Pathogen | Frequency | Seasonality | Key Features |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Enterovirus (coxsackievirus, echovirus) | 50-80% of identified cases | Summer-fall (June-October) | Most common; self-limited; hand-foot-mouth in children; fecal-oral transmission |
| HSV-2 | 5-15% | Year-round | Recurrent meningitis (Mollaret); genital herpes history; usually benign; may need suppressive therapy |
| VZV | 5-10% | Year-round | With or without rash (zoster sine herpete); cranial neuropathies; treat with IV acyclovir |
| HSV-1 | <5% (usually encephalitis) | Year-round | Meningitis rare; more commonly causes encephalitis; temporal lobe tropism |
| West Nile virus | Variable (seasonal) | Summer-fall | Mosquito-borne; elderly at risk; may progress to encephalitis or flaccid paralysis |
| HIV (acute seroconversion) | 10-17% of unexplained aseptic meningitis | Year-round | 2-4 weeks post-exposure; rash, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy; antibody may be negative (check RNA) |
| Mumps | Rare (vaccinated populations) | Late winter-spring | Parotitis; orchitis; unvaccinated populations |
| LCMV (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) | Rare | Winter (rodent exposure) | Hamster/mouse exposure; may cause severe disease in pregnancy |
| Arboviral (EEE, SLE, Powassan) | Rare | Summer-fall | Geographic; vector-borne; may progress to encephalitis |

## APPENDIX C: RED FLAGS — WHEN VIRAL MENINGITIS MAY NOT BE BENIGN

The following features should raise concern for a more serious diagnosis or complicated course:

| Red Flag | Concern | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Altered mental status (GCS <15) | Encephalitis rather than isolated meningitis; brain abscess | STAT MRI brain; continuous EEG; maintain acyclovir and antibiotics |
| Focal neurologic deficits | Encephalitis; stroke; abscess; venous sinus thrombosis | STAT MRI brain with contrast; MRV if venous thrombosis suspected |
| Seizures | Encephalitis (especially HSV); meningoencephalitis | Load antiepileptic medication; continuous EEG; maintain acyclovir |
| Immunocompromised host | Atypical organisms (Cryptococcus, TB, CMV, VZV); poor clearance; higher complication rate | Broader workup; longer empiric therapy; ID consult; consider fungal and TB studies |
| Neonatal age (<28 days) | HSV neonatal encephalitis (high mortality); bacterial sepsis | Pediatric emergency; empiric acyclovir + ampicillin + gentamicin |
| CSF glucose <40 mg/dL or ratio <0.4 | Bacterial, TB, or fungal meningitis rather than viral | Continue full empiric antibiotics; consider TB and fungal workup |
| Opening pressure >30 cm H2O | Bacterial meningitis; cryptococcal meningitis; venous sinus thrombosis | Continue full empiric therapy; cryptococcal antigen; MRV; ICP management |
| Persistent symptoms >2 weeks | Alternative diagnosis (TB, fungal, carcinomatous, autoimmune); partially treated bacterial | Repeat LP; MRI; broaden workup |
| Petechial or purpuric rash | Meningococcemia (N. meningitidis); DIC | Continue antibiotics urgently; coagulation panel; public health notification |
| Recurrent episodes (>2) | Mollaret (HSV-2); anatomic CSF leak; complement deficiency; immunodeficiency | HSV-2 PCR; complement levels; immunoglobulins; skull base imaging |

## APPENDIX D: DE-ESCALATION ALGORITHM

**Goal:** Safely de-escalate empiric antibiotics and acyclovir as results return, minimizing unnecessary antimicrobial exposure while ensuring no treatable infection is missed.

**Step 1 (Hour 0):** Start empiric vancomycin + ceftriaxone (+/- ampicillin) + acyclovir + dexamethasone. Obtain LP.

**Step 2 (Hour 1-2):** BioFire ME Panel results available.
- If BioFire identifies bacterial pathogen → continue antibiotics, adjust per organism
- If BioFire identifies viral pathogen (e.g., enterovirus) → STOP antibiotics and acyclovir
- If BioFire negative → continue empiric therapy; await Gram stain and cultures

**Step 3 (Hour 1-4):** Gram stain and preliminary CSF results.
- Gram stain positive → continue antibiotics
- Gram stain negative + lymphocytic pleocytosis + normal glucose + CSF lactate <3.5 + procalcitonin <0.5 → strongly supports viral; consider stopping antibiotics if clinically non-toxic

**Step 4 (24-48h):** HSV PCR results.
- HSV PCR negative + no encephalitic features + normal or non-temporal MRI → STOP acyclovir
- HSV PCR positive → continue acyclovir (see HSV Encephalitis template or Mollaret management above)

**Step 5 (48-72h):** Final bacterial culture results.
- Cultures negative at 72h → DEFINITIVELY excludes bacterial meningitis; stop any remaining empiric antibiotics
- Cultures positive → treat as bacterial meningitis (see Bacterial Meningitis template)
