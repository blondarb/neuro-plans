# Drug-Induced Parkinsonism

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 30, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Drug-Induced Parkinsonism (DIP)

**ICD-10:** G21.11 (Neuroleptic induced parkinsonism), G21.19 (Other drug induced secondary parkinsonism), G21.0 (Malignant neuroleptic syndrome); CPT: 99213-99215 (E&M outpatient), 99221-99223 (E&M inpatient), 78830 (DaTscan), 70553 (MRI brain with/without contrast)

**SYNONYMS:** Drug-induced parkinsonism, DIP, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism, medication-induced parkinsonism, secondary parkinsonism, antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism, drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms, iatrogenic parkinsonism, medication-related parkinsonism, dopamine blocker parkinsonism, antidopaminergic parkinsonism, metoclopramide-induced parkinsonism, pseudoparkinsonism

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis and management of parkinsonism (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability) caused by dopamine-blocking or dopamine-depleting medications. Covers identification of causative agents, differentiation from idiopathic Parkinson's disease, medication discontinuation/substitution strategies, symptomatic treatment, and psychiatric collaboration for patients requiring continued antipsychotic therapy. Excludes idiopathic Parkinson's disease (separate protocol), vascular parkinsonism, atypical parkinsonian syndromes (PSP, MSA, CBD, DLB), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (acute management), and tardive dyskinesia (separate protocol).

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Drug-Induced Parkinsonism (DIP):** Parkinsonism caused by medications that block or deplete dopamine, typically presenting within days to months of exposure
- **Parkinsonism:** Clinical syndrome of bradykinesia plus at least one of: rest tremor, rigidity, or postural instability
- **Bradykinesia:** Slowness of movement with progressive reduction in speed and amplitude with repetitive actions
- **Rest Tremor:** 4-6 Hz tremor present at rest, suppressed with action (may be less prominent in DIP than idiopathic PD)
- **Dopamine Receptor Blocking Agent (DRBA):** Medications that antagonize D2 dopamine receptors (antipsychotics, antiemetics)
- **DaTscan:** Dopamine transporter imaging used to differentiate DIP (normal uptake) from idiopathic PD (reduced uptake)

---

**COMMON CAUSATIVE AGENTS:**

| Drug Class | High Risk | Moderate Risk | Lower Risk |
|------------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Typical antipsychotics | Haloperidol, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine | Loxapine, thiothixene | - |
| Atypical antipsychotics | Risperidone (dose-dependent) | Olanzapine, ziprasidone, paliperidone | Quetiapine, clozapine, aripiprazole |
| Antiemetics | Metoclopramide, prochlorperazine | Promethazine | Ondansetron (no risk) |

| Mood stabilizers | - | Valproate, lithium | - |
| Other | Tetrabenazine, reserpine (dopamine depletors) | Amiodarone, methyldopa | - |

---

**KEY CLINICAL FEATURES DISTINGUISHING DIP FROM IDIOPATHIC PD:**

| Feature | DIP | Idiopathic PD |
|---------|-----|---------------|
| Onset | Subacute (days to months after drug exposure) | Insidious (months to years) |
| Symmetry | Often bilateral and symmetric | Typically asymmetric, unilateral onset |
| Tremor | Less prominent; postural > rest | Rest tremor classic (4-6 Hz, pill-rolling) |
| Temporal relationship | Onset after causative medication initiation | No drug temporal relationship |
| DaTscan | Normal (presynaptic dopamine intact) | Abnormal (reduced striatal uptake) |
| Resolution | Improves within weeks to months after drug withdrawal | Progressive, no spontaneous improvement |
| Associated features | May have orobuccal dyskinesia, akathisia | Olfactory loss, REM sleep behavior disorder |

## APPENDIX A: Causative Agent Risk Stratification and Substitution Guide

**High-Risk Agents (Discontinue or Substitute Immediately):**

| Causative Agent | Recommended Substitute | Notes |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------|
| Haloperidol | Quetiapine or clozapine | Coordinate with psychiatry; haloperidol has highest EPS risk |
| Chlorpromazine | Quetiapine or aripiprazole | Lower-potency typical but still significant EPS risk |
| Fluphenazine (including decanoate) | Quetiapine or clozapine | Decanoate formulation: effects persist weeks after last injection |
| Risperidone (>4 mg/day) | Quetiapine, aripiprazole, or reduce to <4 mg/day | EPS risk is dose-dependent |
| Metoclopramide | Ondansetron (antiemetic); erythromycin or domperidone (prokinetic) | FDA black box warning for prolonged use |
| Prochlorperazine | Ondansetron or meclizine | Common ER prescription for nausea/vertigo |

**Moderate-Risk Agents (Reduce Dose or Monitor Closely):**

| Causative Agent | Recommended Action | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Olanzapine | Reduce dose; consider switch to quetiapine | EPS less common than typicals but dose-related |
| Valproate | Reduce to therapeutic minimum; consider alternative mood stabilizer | Parkinsonism typically reversible with dose reduction |
| Lithium | Check level; reduce to minimum therapeutic | Toxicity increases EPS risk |
| Flunarizine/cinnarizine | Discontinue; substitute alternative migraine prophylaxis | Common cause outside US; reversible |

## APPENDIX B: DaTscan Interpretation Guide for DIP

**When to Order DaTscan:**
- Diagnostic uncertainty between DIP and idiopathic PD
- Parkinsonism persists >6 months after causative agent withdrawal
- Atypical features suggesting underlying neurodegenerative process
- Patient requires urgent diagnostic clarification (e.g., before surgery)

**Interpretation:**

| DaTscan Result | Interpretation | Clinical Action |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Normal bilateral striatal uptake | Supports pure DIP; presynaptic dopamine neurons intact | Continue observation; expect resolution after drug withdrawal; reassess in 3-6 months |
| Reduced striatal uptake (asymmetric) | Suggests underlying idiopathic PD unmasked by DRBA | Refer to movement disorders specialist; consider levodopa trial; DIP may have unmasked subclinical PD |
| Reduced striatal uptake (symmetric) | May indicate PD or atypical parkinsonism unmasked by DRBA | Movement disorders specialist; further workup for atypical parkinsonism |

**Medications That Interfere with DaTscan (Hold Before Study):**
- Bupropion (hold 2 weeks)
- Amphetamines/methylphenidate (hold 2 weeks)
- Modafinil (hold 2 weeks)
- Cocaine (hold 2 weeks)
- Phentermine (hold 2 weeks)
- Benztropine and anticholinergics do NOT interfere

**DaTscan Does NOT Differentiate Between:**
- PD and atypical parkinsonism (PSP, MSA, CBD) - all may show reduced uptake
- PD subtypes (tremor-dominant vs PIGD)

## APPENDIX C: DIP Resolution Timeline and Follow-Up Protocol

**Expected Resolution Timeline After Drug Withdrawal:**

| Timeframe | Expected Clinical Course | Action |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| Week 1-2 | Minimal change; may initially worsen slightly after antipsychotic withdrawal | Reassure patient; monitor psychiatric status |
| Week 2-4 | Early improvement in bradykinesia and rigidity expected | Continue symptomatic treatment if needed |
| Month 1-3 | Significant improvement in most patients; tremor may be last to resolve | Consider tapering symptomatic medications |
| Month 3-6 | Full resolution expected in most patients | If persistent, order DaTscan |
| Month 6-12 | Any residual symptoms raise concern for underlying PD | Movement disorders referral; levodopa trial |
| >12 months | Persistent parkinsonism highly suggests underlying PD unmasked by DRBA | Manage as idiopathic PD |

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
1. **2 weeks post-discontinuation:** Psychiatric status, initial motor assessment, medication review
2. **4 weeks post-discontinuation:** Motor re-examination, UPDRS scoring, assess functional improvement
3. **3 months post-discontinuation:** Comprehensive motor assessment; if not improving, order DaTscan
4. **6 months post-discontinuation:** Final assessment; if fully resolved, educate on future medication avoidance
5. **As needed:** If symptoms recur or new medications started
