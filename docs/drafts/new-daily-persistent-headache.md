# New Daily Persistent Headache (NDPH)

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** February 9, 2026
**REVISED:** February 9, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft — Awaiting physician review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** New Daily Persistent Headache (NDPH)

**ICD-10:** G44.52 (New daily persistent headache), G44.1 (Vascular headache, not elsewhere classified), R51.9 (Headache, unspecified)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC), 80048 (BMP), 84443 (TSH), 86140 (CRP), 85651 (ESR), 82607 (Vitamin B12), 70553 (MRI brain with/without contrast), 70547 (MRA head), 70549 (MRA neck), 72141 (MRI cervical spine), 89050 (CSF cell count), 89321 (CSF protein), 89322 (CSF glucose), 89325 (CSF opening pressure), 95816 (EEG), 70450 (CT head without contrast), 71046 (Chest X-ray)

**SYNONYMS:** NDPH, new daily persistent headache, de novo chronic daily headache, daily headache from onset, persistent daily headache with clear onset, chronic headache with identifiable onset date

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of new daily persistent headache (NDPH) as defined by ICHD-3 criteria. Includes comprehensive secondary headache exclusion, subtype characterization (migraine-like vs tension-like), and treatment approaches. Covers ED evaluation for secondary headache mimics, inpatient bridge therapy for severe cases, and outpatient chronic management. NDPH is one of the most treatment-refractory primary headache disorders and requires systematic evaluation.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **New daily persistent headache (ICHD-3):** Persistent headache, daily from onset (or within 24 hours of onset), that is clearly remembered; the patient can typically pinpoint the exact date of onset; headache is unremitting, present for >3 months; not better accounted for by another headache disorder
- **NDPH — migraine-like subtype:** NDPH with migrainous features (unilateral, pulsating, moderate-severe, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia); may respond partially to migraine treatments
- **NDPH — tension-like subtype:** NDPH with tension-type features (bilateral, pressing, mild-moderate, no nausea); historically more treatment-refractory
- **Self-limiting subtype:** Minority of NDPH patients (approximately 15-20%) whose headache resolves spontaneously within months; no reliable predictors
- **Refractory subtype:** Majority of NDPH patients who are resistant to standard headache therapies; persists for years despite treatment

---

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

---

## RED FLAGS — Exclude Secondary Causes Before NDPH Diagnosis

- **Elevated intracranial pressure:** Papilledema, pulsatile tinnitus, positional worsening, visual obscurations → MRI/MRV, LP with opening pressure
- **Low intracranial pressure:** Orthostatic headache (worse upright, better lying down), history of LP/epidural/trauma → MRI with gadolinium (pachymeningeal enhancement)
- **Cerebral venous thrombosis:** Headache with papilledema, seizure, focal deficit → MRV
- **Cervical artery dissection:** New headache with neck pain, Horner syndrome, focal deficit → MRA neck/CTA
- **CNS infection:** Fever, meningismus, altered mental status → LP, MRI with contrast
- **Neoplasm:** Progressive headache with focal signs, weight loss, cancer history → MRI with contrast

## 4. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS

### 4A. Referrals & Consults

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Headache specialist/neurologist for comprehensive NDPH evaluation, secondary cause exclusion, and treatment planning — NDPH is among the most challenging headache disorders and benefits from specialist management | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Pain psychology/behavioral medicine for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), biofeedback, relaxation training, and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) — psychological approaches are important given refractory nature of NDPH | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Physical therapy for cervicogenic component assessment, myofascial trigger point therapy, posture correction, and aerobic exercise program | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Psychiatry if significant comorbid depression or anxiety; NDPH is psychologically devastating and requires mental health support | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| NDPH is a recognized medical condition — the headache is real, it has a name, and research is ongoing; validation is an important part of treatment | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Keep a detailed headache diary recording daily pain intensity (0-10), headache character (pulsating, pressing), associated symptoms, medications taken, and functional impact | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid medication overuse (taking acute pain medications >10-15 days/month) — this can cause medication overuse headache superimposed on NDPH, making it even harder to treat | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Maintain regular sleep schedule (consistent bed and wake times), eat regular meals, exercise 30 minutes daily, and stay well hydrated — lifestyle regularity improves headache management | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Understand that NDPH is often treatment-resistant and may require trials of multiple medications and combinations before finding effective treatment; set realistic expectations | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| A subset of NDPH patients (15-20%) experience spontaneous resolution within months to a few years; this possibility provides hope even during refractory periods | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Regular aerobic exercise 30-45 minutes, 5 days/week — evidence supports exercise as beneficial for chronic headache reduction | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Stress management: CBT, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), biofeedback, relaxation techniques — psychological approaches are essential given the chronic nature | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid known migraine triggers if migraine-like subtype: alcohol, processed foods, irregular meals, sleep deprivation, excessive caffeine | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Limit caffeine to <=200 mg/day (2 cups coffee) and keep intake consistent; avoid abrupt caffeine withdrawal | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Maintain healthy weight — obesity is a risk factor for headache chronification | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Chronic migraine (transformed from episodic) | History of pre-existing episodic migraine that gradually increased in frequency; no clear-cut onset date; unlike NDPH which starts de novo at high frequency | Headache history documenting prior episodic migraine; ICHD-3 criteria for chronic migraine (>=15 days/month, >=8 with migrainous features) |
| Medication overuse headache (MOH) | Daily headache in setting of frequent acute medication use (>=10-15 days/month); headache improves with withdrawal of overused medication; may coexist with NDPH | Medication diary showing overuse; 2-month washout trial; headache improvement after withdrawal |
| Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) | Headache with papilledema; pulsatile tinnitus; visual obscurations; worse with Valsalva; typically overweight women of childbearing age | Fundoscopy (papilledema); LP opening pressure >25 cm H2O; MRI (empty sella, transverse sinus stenosis, optic nerve sheath distention) |
| Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) | Orthostatic headache (dramatically worse upright, better lying down); subdural collections; may have history of LP, epidural, or connective tissue disease | MRI with contrast (pachymeningeal enhancement, subdural collections, brain sagging); LP opening pressure <6 cm H2O; CT myelogram to find CSF leak |
| Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT) | Headache with papilledema, seizures, or focal deficit; risk factors (OCP, pregnancy, thrombophilia, infection) | MRV showing thrombosis; D-dimer (sensitivity but not specificity); hypercoagulable workup |
| Chronic meningitis | Headache with low-grade fever, cranial neuropathy, cognitive change; CSF pleocytosis | LP: elevated protein, lymphocytic pleocytosis; cultures (TB, fungal, bacterial); cytology; MRI enhancement |
| Cervicogenic headache | Unilateral headache provoked by neck movement or sustained posture; ipsilateral neck/shoulder pain; reduced cervical ROM | Clinical exam (provoked by neck maneuvers); diagnostic cervical medial branch block; MRI cervical spine |
| Hemicrania continua | Strictly unilateral continuous headache with cranial autonomic features (tearing, rhinorrhea, ptosis) and absolute response to indomethacin | Indomethacin trial (75-225 mg/day): COMPLETE response is diagnostic; partial response → not HC |
| Post-traumatic headache | Daily headache developing within 7 days of head trauma or regaining consciousness after trauma; similar phenotype to NDPH but temporal relationship to injury | History of head trauma; onset within 7 days; may resolve within 3-12 months or persist |

## NOTES

- NDPH is one of the most treatment-refractory primary headache disorders — set realistic expectations with patients and emphasize multimodal approach
- The hallmark of NDPH is that the patient can remember the exact date the headache started (e.g., "It started on March 15th and has been there every day since")
- Common triggers include viral infection (especially EBV), stressful life event, surgical procedure, or initiation of a new medication — document the trigger
- NDPH is a diagnosis of exclusion — comprehensive secondary headache workup (MRI, MRV, LP with opening pressure) is mandatory before making this diagnosis
- Two subtypes: migraine-like (better prognosis, may respond to migraine therapies) and tension-like (more refractory, fewer treatment options)
- Medication overuse headache frequently complicates NDPH — monitor acute medication use carefully and limit to <10 days/month
- Approximately 15-20% of NDPH patients experience spontaneous remission — this is important for patient hope and counseling
- Combined approach is usually necessary: pharmacologic prevention + behavioral (CBT) + lifestyle (exercise, sleep, stress management) + interventional (nerve blocks)
- Emerging therapies: CGRP antibodies (off-label), ketamine infusions, doxycycline, vagal nerve stimulation — referral to specialized headache center for refractory cases
- Avoid opioids for NDPH management — high risk of MOH, dependence, and worsening chronification
