# Low Pressure Headache / Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 30, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Low Pressure Headache / Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension (SIH)

**CPT CODES:** 62270 (Lumbar puncture, diagnostic), 62272 (Therapeutic spinal puncture), 62273 (Epidural blood patch), 72141 (MRI cervical spine without contrast), 72146 (MRI thoracic spine without contrast), 72148 (MRI lumbar spine without contrast), 72156 (MRI cervical spine with and without contrast), 72157 (MRI thoracic spine with and without contrast), 70553 (MRI brain with and without contrast), 72240 (CT myelography, cervical), 72255 (CT myelography, thoracic), 72265 (CT myelography, lumbar), 78630 (Cisternography, radionuclide), 62320 (Epidural injection, cervical/thoracic), 62322 (Epidural injection, lumbar/sacral)

**SYNONYMS:** Spontaneous intracranial hypotension, SIH, low CSF pressure headache, CSF leak headache, CSF hypovolemia, intracranial hypotension, orthostatic headache, postural headache, post-dural puncture headache, PDPH, post-LP headache, post-lumbar puncture headache, spinal headache, CSF fistula, dural tear headache, spontaneous CSF leak, meningeal diverticulum leak, spinal CSF leak, low-pressure syndrome, CSF hypotension syndrome, spontaneous spinal CSF leak, pachymeningeal enhancement headache, brain sagging, cerebral ptosis, sinking brain syndrome

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of headache due to low cerebrospinal fluid pressure in adults. Covers spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), post-lumbar puncture headache (PDPH), and post-surgical/post-traumatic CSF leaks. Includes diagnostic workup (MRI brain, MRI spine, CT myelography, cisternography), conservative management, epidural blood patch, and surgical repair for refractory cases. Excludes cranial CSF rhinorrhea/otorrhea from skull base defects (managed by otolaryngology/neurosurgery), and CSF leaks secondary to VP shunt overdrainage.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**

- **Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension (SIH):** Low CSF pressure (<6 cm H2O) or CSF hypovolemia from spontaneous spinal CSF leak, causing orthostatic headache and characteristic MRI findings
- **Post-Dural Puncture Headache (PDPH):** Headache occurring within 5 days of lumbar puncture or spinal anesthesia, typically orthostatic, due to persistent dural rent and CSF leak
- **Orthostatic Headache:** Headache that worsens significantly within 15 minutes of assuming upright posture and improves within 15-30 minutes of recumbency
- **Epidural Blood Patch (EBP):** Injection of autologous blood into the epidural space to seal a dural defect and restore CSF volume
- **Pachymeningeal Enhancement:** Diffuse, smooth, non-nodular dural enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced MRI, characteristic of intracranial hypotension
- **CSF Hypovolemia:** Reduction in total CSF volume causing brain sagging and traction on pain-sensitive structures, even when opening pressure may be normal
- **Dural Ectasia:** Weakness and ballooning of the dural sac, often associated with connective tissue disorders, predisposing to CSF leaks
- **CSF-Venous Fistula:** Abnormal connection between a spinal nerve root sleeve and an adjacent epidural vein, causing CSF drainage into the venous system

## NOTES

- SIH is often underdiagnosed; maintain high suspicion in any patient with new orthostatic headache
- Classic triad: orthostatic headache, diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement on MRI, low CSF opening pressure (though OP may be normal in 20-30%)
- MRI brain with gadolinium is the most important diagnostic test; do NOT rely on LP alone
- PDPH typically self-resolves within 1-2 weeks; EBP indicated if symptoms persist beyond 24-48 hours or are severe
- For SIH, blind EBP success rate is only 30-50% (vs. 70-90% for PDPH); targeted EBP after leak localization is preferred
- CSF-venous fistulas are an increasingly recognized cause of SIH; require specialized imaging (digital subtraction myelography) for diagnosis
- Subdural hematomas in SIH patients should be treated by addressing the underlying CSF leak first; surgical evacuation alone leads to high recurrence
- LP in suspected SIH may worsen symptoms and should be deferred if MRI brain findings are classic; when performed, use smallest gauge needle and remove minimal volume
- Connective tissue disorders (Ehlers-Danlos, Marfan) are risk factors; screen if recurrent or young patient
- Rebound intracranial hypertension can occur after successful CSF leak treatment; monitor for new headache pattern (worse lying down)
- Chronic SIH can lead to superficial siderosis from repeated microbleeding along the neuroaxis
