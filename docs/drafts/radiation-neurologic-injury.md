# Radiation-Induced Neurologic Injury

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** February 11, 2026
**REVISED:** February 11, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Radiation-Induced Neurologic Injury

**ICD-10:** G93.89 (Other specified disorders of brain), T66.XXXA (Radiation sickness, unspecified, initial encounter), G95.89 (Other specified diseases of spinal cord)

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and management of radiation-induced CNS injury in adults. Covers acute radiation injury (during or within days of treatment), early-delayed radiation injury (1-6 months post-radiation), and late-delayed radiation injury including radiation necrosis (months to years post-radiation), radiation myelopathy, cranial neuropathies (optic neuropathy, vestibulocochlear injury, lower cranial nerve palsies), radiation-induced cognitive decline, radiation-induced leukoencephalopathy, radiation-induced cerebrovascular disease (moyamoya, cavernomas, accelerated atherosclerosis), and radiation-induced secondary neoplasms. Includes differentiation of radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence/progression (a critical diagnostic challenge). Excludes acute radiation syndrome from nuclear/radiological emergencies, brachytherapy-specific complications, and pediatric radiation injury (separate templates).

## 3. TREATMENT

**CRITICAL:** Treatment of radiation-induced neurologic injury requires distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence, as management differs fundamentally. Multidisciplinary input (neuro-oncology, radiation oncology, neurosurgery, neuroradiology) is essential. Timing of injury relative to radiation guides treatment selection.

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Tumor recurrence/progression | Most critical differential; enhancing lesion in radiation field may be recurrence or necrosis; occurs at similar timeframe; may present with worsening neurologic deficits identical to radiation necrosis | MR perfusion (high rCBV >1.75 favors tumor); MR spectroscopy (elevated choline, high Cho/NAA favors tumor); FET-PET (high uptake favors tumor); stereotactic biopsy for definitive diagnosis; mixed pathology (tumor + necrosis) common |
| Pseudoprogression | Transient increase in enhancement within 3-6 months of completing chemoradiation (especially with temozolomide); more common in MGMT-methylated tumors; may resolve spontaneously | Timing (typically 1-6 months post-RT); clinical stability favors pseudoprogression; serial MRI showing stabilization or improvement; MR perfusion may be equivocal; RANO criteria; biopsy if persistent |
| Brain abscess | Ring-enhancing lesion; may occur in immunosuppressed post-radiation patient; central restricted diffusion on DWI (unlike radiation necrosis) | DWI: central restricted diffusion (bright DWI, dark ADC) = abscess; radiation necrosis has facilitated diffusion; MR spectroscopy (amino acid peaks in abscess); blood cultures; fever, leukocytosis |
| Demyelinating disease (MS, ADEM) | White matter lesions may mimic leukoencephalopathy; typically outside radiation field; younger patients; clinical relapses | Distribution outside radiation field; CSF oligoclonal bands; MRI dissemination in time and space (McDonald criteria); MOG/AQP4 antibodies |
| Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) | White matter disease in immunosuppressed patient; asymmetric; no enhancement typically; may occur in cancer patients on immunosuppressive therapy | JC virus PCR in CSF; immunosuppression history; MRI showing progressive non-enhancing white matter lesions; no mass effect (unlike radiation necrosis) |
| Radiation-induced secondary neoplasm (meningioma, glioma, sarcoma) | New lesion arising years to decades after radiation; different location or character from original tumor; meningioma is most common radiation-induced neoplasm | Long latency (typically >5-10 years for meningiomas, >3 years for gliomas); lesion characteristics different from original tumor; tissue biopsy for definitive diagnosis |
| Cerebrovascular disease (stroke) | Acute onset; vascular territory distribution; radiation-induced vasculopathy may cause ischemic stroke in irradiated vascular territories | MRI DWI (restricted diffusion in vascular territory); MRA/CTA showing stenosis or occlusion; clinical history of sudden onset; vascular territory pattern (vs. radiation field pattern) |
| Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis | Progressive cranial neuropathies, radiculopathy, cognitive decline after radiation for brain tumor; enhancing leptomeninges on MRI | CSF cytology (positive for malignant cells); leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI; elevated CSF protein; flow cytometry |
| Normal pressure hydrocephalus | Gait disturbance, cognitive decline, urinary incontinence; may develop after radiation-induced adhesions or obstruction | Gait apraxia pattern; urinary symptoms early; CT/MRI showing ventriculomegaly out of proportion to sulcal atrophy; lumbar drainage trial; radiation history with posterior fossa involvement |
| Medication-related neurotoxicity | AEDs, steroids, chemotherapy may cause cognitive decline, fatigue, weakness mimicking radiation injury | Temporal relationship to medication changes; improvement with dose reduction or discontinuation; drug levels if applicable |

## APPENDIX C: RADIATION DOSE TOLERANCE FOR CNS STRUCTURES

| Structure | Conventional Tolerance (TD 5/5) | Maximum Safe Dose | Injury Type if Exceeded |
|-----------|--------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Whole brain | 45-54 Gy (conventional fractionation) | 60 Gy in 30 fractions | Leukoencephalopathy, cognitive decline, necrosis |
| Brainstem | 54 Gy | 59 Gy (small volume) | Cranial neuropathies, necrosis, death |
| Spinal cord | 45-50 Gy | 50 Gy (full cross-section) | Radiation myelopathy |
| Optic nerves/chiasm | 54 Gy | 55 Gy (point dose) | Radiation optic neuropathy (blindness) |
| Cochlea | 45 Gy (mean) | 45 Gy mean dose | Sensorineural hearing loss |
| Hippocampus | Minimize dose | Hippocampal avoidance WBRT preferred | Memory impairment |
| Hypothalamic-pituitary axis | 18 Gy (GH loss) | Dose-dependent deficits | Panhypopituitarism (dose-dependent) |
| Lens | 10 Gy | 10 Gy | Cataracts |
| Retina | 45 Gy | 50 Gy | Radiation retinopathy |
| Carotid arteries | Minimize dose | Variable | Accelerated atherosclerosis, stenosis |
