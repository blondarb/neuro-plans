# Paresthesia / Numbness / Tingling

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** February 2, 2026
**STATUS:** Initial build

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Paresthesia / Numbness / Tingling

**ICD-10:** R20.2 (Paresthesia of skin); R20.0 (Anesthesia of skin); R20.1 (Hypoesthesia of skin); R20.8 (Other disturbances of skin sensation); R20.9 (Unspecified disturbances of skin sensation)

**CPT CODES:** 95907-95913 (nerve conduction studies, NCS), 95886 (EMG, each extremity), 95885 (EMG, limited), 70553 (MRI brain with/without contrast), 72141 (MRI cervical spine without contrast), 72156 (MRI cervical spine with/without contrast), 72148 (MRI lumbar spine without contrast), 72158 (MRI lumbar spine with/without contrast), 72146 (MRI thoracic spine without contrast), 85025 (CBC with differential), 80053 (CMP), 83036 (HbA1c), 82607 (vitamin B12), 84443 (TSH), 86235 (ANA), 85652 (ESR), 86140 (CRP), 89240 (QSART), 95923 (autonomic function testing), 11104 (skin punch biopsy for IENFD)

**SYNONYMS:** Paresthesia, numbness, tingling, pins and needles, sensory loss, hypoesthesia, dysesthesia, numbness and tingling, acroparesthesia, prickling sensation, altered sensation, sensory disturbance, neuropathic sensory symptoms, loss of feeling, dead feeling in extremities

**SCOPE:** Systematic evaluation of undifferentiated paresthesia, numbness, or tingling presenting to ED, hospital, or outpatient neurology. Focuses on neuroanatomic localization (peripheral nerve, plexus, root, spinal cord, brainstem/brain), pattern recognition (stocking-glove, dermatomal, hemisensory, non-anatomic), etiologic laboratory workup, electrodiagnostic and imaging indications, and identification of red flags requiring emergent intervention. This is an EVALUATION template. For specific established diagnoses, refer to dedicated plans: Peripheral Neuropathy, Radiculopathy, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Small Fiber Neuropathy, GBS, CIDP, Acute Myelopathy, MS - New Diagnosis.
