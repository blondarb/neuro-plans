# Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** January 30, 2026
**REVISED:** January 30, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)

**ICD-10:** I67.83 (Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome), I67.4 (Hypertensive encephalopathy), O15.0 (Eclampsia in pregnancy), O15.1 (Eclampsia in labor), O15.2 (Eclampsia in the puerperium), O15.9 (Eclampsia, unspecified as to time period), I16.1 (Hypertensive emergency), G40.901 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, with status epilepticus), R56.9 (Unspecified convulsions), G93.49 (Other encephalopathy, not elsewhere classified)

**SYNONYMS:** Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, PRES, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, RPLS, posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy, hypertensive encephalopathy, reversible posterior cerebral edema syndrome, posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, PRES syndrome, eclamptic encephalopathy, immunosuppressant-associated encephalopathy, calcineurin inhibitor neurotoxicity, tacrolimus neurotoxicity, cyclosporine neurotoxicity, reversible cerebral edema, vasogenic edema syndrome, hypertensive brain edema

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis and management of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in adults across all care settings. Covers hypertensive emergency management, seizure treatment, identification and removal of causative agents (immunosuppressants, chemotherapy), eclampsia-specific management, MRI interpretation, hemorrhagic PRES complications, and recovery monitoring. Excludes pediatric PRES, chronic hypertensive encephalopathy without neuroimaging features, and isolated eclampsia management without PRES features (see obstetric protocols).

## 3. TREATMENT

### CRITICAL PRIORITIES IN ACUTE PRES (First 60 Minutes)
1. **Blood pressure reduction** -- target 25% reduction in MAP in first hour; then to 160/100 over next 2-6 hours
2. **Seizure control** -- levetiracetam first-line; magnesium sulfate if eclampsia
3. **Identify and address underlying cause** -- hold immunosuppressants, deliver fetus if eclampsia, treat renal failure
4. **Airway protection** -- intubate if GCS <=8 or unable to protect airway

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Acute ischemic stroke | Focal neurological deficit corresponding to vascular territory; DWI restriction on MRI; absence of bilateral posterior edema | MRI DWI (restricted diffusion in arterial territory); CTA (vessel occlusion); PRES shows vasogenic edema with elevated ADC |
| Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) | Headache, seizures, focal deficits; hemorrhagic venous infarct; does not respect arterial territories; postpartum | MRV or CT venography (thrombosed sinus); D-dimer; PRES has bilateral posterior edema without sinus thrombosis |
| CNS vasculitis | Multifocal lesions; vessel wall enhancement; progressive course; may have systemic vasculitis features | DSA (irregular segmental narrowing); vessel wall MRI; CSF (pleocytosis, elevated protein); biopsy |
| HSV encephalitis | Fever; temporal lobe involvement (mesial temporal, insular cortex); CSF pleocytosis; rapid deterioration | MRI (temporal lobe edema/hemorrhage); CSF HSV PCR; PRES involves parietal-occipital predominantly |
| Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) | Thunderclap headache; segmental vasoconstriction on CTA/DSA; resolves in 3 months; may coexist with PRES | CTA/DSA (multifocal segmental narrowing resolving on follow-up); RCVS and PRES can overlap |
| Hypertensive encephalopathy without PRES features | Headache, confusion, seizures with severe hypertension but NO characteristic posterior vasogenic edema on MRI | MRI (no posterior vasogenic edema pattern); clinical improvement with BP control is similar |
| Autoimmune encephalitis | Subacute onset; psychiatric symptoms; seizures; antibody-mediated | CSF (antibodies: NMDA-R, LGI1, CASPR2); MRI pattern different (mesial temporal); EEG (extreme delta brush in anti-NMDA-R) |

| Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) | Thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurological symptoms, renal dysfunction, fever | ADAMTS13 activity (<10%); schistocytes; TTP can coexist with PRES |
| Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) | Rapid sodium correction; central pontine or extrapontine myelinolysis; may occur in hyponatremia correction | MRI (central pons T2/FLAIR hyperintensity); sodium correction history; location differs from PRES |
| Posterior circulation stroke | Acute onset; brainstem/cerebellar signs; unilateral or asymmetric; DWI restriction | MRI DWI (restricted diffusion in PCA territory); CTA (basilar/PCA occlusion); PRES is bilateral and vasogenic |

## APPENDIX A: PRES Diagnostic Criteria and MRI Interpretation

### Clinical Features Suggestive of PRES

| Feature | Frequency | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Headache | 50-80% | Often severe; may be thunderclap |
| Seizures | 60-75% | Generalized tonic-clonic most common; may be focal or status epilepticus |
| Visual disturbance | 30-65% | Cortical blindness, blurred vision, hemianopia, visual neglect |
| Altered consciousness | 30-55% | Confusion to coma; may be from NCSE |
| Nausea/vomiting | 25-40% | Associated with elevated ICP and hypertension |
| Focal neurological deficits | 10-25% | Hemiparesis, aphasia (atypical -- consider stroke) |

### MRI Interpretation Guide for PRES

| Sequence | Typical PRES Finding | Significance |
|----------|---------------------|--------------|
| FLAIR | Bilateral symmetric hyperintensity in posterior parietal-occipital white matter; may extend to frontal lobes, temporal lobes, brainstem, cerebellum | Confirms vasogenic edema; posterior predominance is classic but NOT required |
| DWI | Normal or mildly hyperintense | True restricted diffusion suggests cytotoxic edema (irreversible injury) |
| ADC | Elevated (bright) in affected regions | Confirms VASOGENIC edema (reversible); decreased ADC = cytotoxic edema (irreversible infarction) |
| SWI/GRE | May show petechial hemorrhage, microbleeds, or frank hemorrhage | Hemorrhagic PRES in 15-25%; associated with worse outcomes |
| Post-contrast | Usually no enhancement; mild enhancement possible | Significant enhancement suggests alternative diagnosis (tumor, abscess, vasculitis) |
| Follow-up FLAIR (2-4 weeks) | Resolution of abnormalities | Confirms PRES diagnosis and reversibility; persistent changes suggest irreversible injury |

### PRES Distribution Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Frequency |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Dominant parietal-occipital | Classic posterior pattern | 70% |
| Holohemispheric watershed | Frontal and parietal watershed zones | 20% |
| Superior frontal sulcus | Frontal predominance | 5-10% |
| Posterior fossa (brainstem/cerebellum) | High risk for herniation | 5-15% |
| Atypical (basal ganglia, thalamus, spinal cord) | Consider alternative diagnosis | <5% |

## APPENDIX B: Common Causes of PRES and Management Approach

| Cause Category | Specific Causes | Key Management |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|

| **Eclampsia/Preeclampsia** | Pregnancy-induced hypertension with seizures; HELLP syndrome; postpartum eclampsia | Magnesium sulfate; delivery of fetus is definitive treatment; labetalol or hydralazine for BP |
| **Immunosuppressants** | Tacrolimus; cyclosporine; sirolimus (rare) | Hold or reduce offending agent; coordinate with transplant team; switch to alternative |
| **Chemotherapy/Targeted therapy** | Bevacizumab; sunitinib; sorafenib; cisplatin; gemcitabine; cytarabine | Hold offending agent; oncology consult for alternative regimen |
| **Autoimmune/Inflammatory** | SLE; polyarteritis nodosa; scleroderma renal crisis; granulomatosis with polyangiitis | Treat underlying autoimmune disease; BP control; immunosuppression (ironic but needed) |
| **Renal disease** | Acute kidney injury; chronic kidney disease; dialysis patients; nephrotic syndrome | Nephrology consult; dialysis if indicated; fluid and BP management |
| **Bone marrow/Stem cell transplant** | GVHD treatment with calcineurin inhibitors; conditioning regimens; infections | Adjust immunosuppression; BMT team coordination; infection workup |
| **Blood transfusion/Erythropoietin** | Rapid hemoglobin correction; EPO-induced hypertension | Slow transfusion rate; adjust EPO dose; BP control |
| **Sepsis/Infection** | Gram-positive sepsis; endotoxemia; urinary tract infection with sepsis | Treat underlying infection; supportive care; BP management |
| **Post-organ transplant (early)** | Immediate post-transplant period; high-dose immunosuppression; fluid shifts | Coordinate with transplant team; immunosuppressant adjustment; fluid balance |
