## CHANGE LOG

**v1.0 (January 27, 2026)**
- Initial template creation
- Comprehensive coverage of classic and secondary TN
- First-line (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine) and second-line medical therapies
- Surgical options including MVD, percutaneous procedures, and stereotactic radiosurgery
- Structured dosing format for order sentence generation
- PubMed citations with verified PMIDs

---

## APPENDIX A: TN Classification (ICHD-3)

### Classical Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN1)
- Paroxysmal attacks lasting fraction of a second to 2 minutes
- Unilateral distribution in trigeminal territory
- Triggered by innocuous stimuli (light touch, chewing, talking, cold wind)
- Electric shock-like, shooting, stabbing quality
- Stereotyped in individual patient
- No neurological deficit
- MRI shows neurovascular compression OR is normal

### Secondary Trigeminal Neuralgia
- Same attack characteristics as classical TN
- Underlying cause identified:
  - Multiple sclerosis (demyelinating lesion in root entry zone)
  - Tumor (schwannoma, meningioma, epidermoid)
  - Arteriovenous malformation
  - Other structural lesion
- May have neurological deficit (sensory loss, weakness)

### Idiopathic Trigeminal Neuralgia
- Same attack characteristics as classical TN
- No neurovascular compression on imaging
- No identified secondary cause

### Trigeminal Neuralgia with Concomitant Continuous Pain (TN2/Atypical)
- Classical TN attacks PLUS
- Continuous or near-continuous background pain in same distribution
- More difficult to treat; may indicate central sensitization

## APPENDIX B: Carbamazepine Drug Interactions

### Major Interactions (Avoid or Adjust)
| Drug/Class | Interaction | Management |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| MAOIs | Serotonin syndrome risk | Contraindicated |
| Nefazodone | Decreased CBZ metabolism; increased toxicity | Avoid |
| Oral contraceptives | Decreased efficacy (CYP3A4 induction) | Use alternative contraception |
| Warfarin | Decreased warfarin effect | Monitor INR closely |
| Doxycycline | Decreased doxycycline levels | Use alternative antibiotic |
| Macrolide antibiotics | Increased CBZ levels (CYP3A4 inhibition) | Monitor for toxicity |
| Azole antifungals | Increased CBZ levels | Monitor for toxicity |
| HIV protease inhibitors | Variable; decreased PI levels | Avoid or use with caution |
| Grapefruit juice | Increased CBZ absorption | Avoid |

### Autoinduction
- Carbamazepine induces its own metabolism
- Steady-state levels decrease 3-4 weeks after initiation
- May need dose increase after 2-4 weeks

## APPENDIX C: Surgical Option Comparison
