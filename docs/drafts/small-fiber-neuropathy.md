# Small Fiber Neuropathy

**DIAGNOSIS:** Small Fiber Neuropathy (SFN)
**ICD-10:** G62.9 (Polyneuropathy, unspecified); G62.89 (Other specified polyneuropathies); G90.09 (Other idiopathic peripheral autonomic neuropathy)
**SCOPE:** Diagnosis and management of small fiber neuropathy presenting with painful sensory and/or autonomic symptoms with normal or near-normal nerve conduction studies. Includes length-dependent and non-length-dependent (ganglionopathy) patterns. Covers etiologic workup for treatable causes, symptomatic pain management, and autonomic symptom treatment.

**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

**CLINICAL SYNONYMS:** SFN; Small fiber sensory neuropathy; Small fiber predominant neuropathy; Pure small fiber neuropathy; Painful small fiber neuropathy; Autonomic small fiber neuropathy; Sensory ganglionopathy (non-length-dependent pattern)

---

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

**KEY CLINICAL FEATURES:**
- **Definition:** Neuropathy affecting small myelinated (Aδ) and unmyelinated (C) nerve fibers
- **Sensory symptoms:** Burning pain, allodynia, hyperalgesia, paresthesias, "pins and needles"
- **Autonomic symptoms:** Sudomotor dysfunction (dry skin, hyperhidrosis), orthostatic intolerance, GI dysmotility, urinary symptoms, sicca symptoms
- **Key diagnostic criterion:** Clinical neuropathy with normal or near-normal NCS (which test large fibers only)
- **Gold standard confirmation:** Skin biopsy with reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD)

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Diabetic polyneuropathy (large fiber) | NCS abnormal; mixed sensorimotor findings; more numbness than pain | EMG/NCS shows axonal polyneuropathy |
| Fibromyalgia | Widespread pain; tender points; normal skin biopsy; chronic fatigue | ACR criteria; normal IENFD on skin biopsy |
| Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) | Regional rather than length-dependent; swelling, color changes, dystrophy | Budapest criteria; regional distribution |
| Erythromelalgia | Intermittent burning with redness and warmth; triggered by heat; may have SCN9A mutation | Clinical pattern; genetic testing if suspected |
| Central sensitization syndromes | Normal peripheral testing; pain out of proportion to objective findings | QST pattern; skin biopsy normal |
| Psychogenic/functional sensory symptoms | Non-anatomical distribution; inconsistent findings; psychiatric comorbidity | Careful neurological exam; normal objective testing |
| Vitamin B12 deficiency | May have subacute combined degeneration; cognitive changes; macrocytic anemia | B12, MMA levels; MRI spine |
| Lyme disease | Endemic area; prior tick bite; rash history; may have radiculopathy | Lyme serology (ELISA + Western blot) |
| Hereditary sensory neuropathy (HSAN) | Family history; anhidrosis; painless injuries; mutilating features | Genetic testing (HSAN genes) |
| Burning mouth syndrome | Isolated to oral mucosa; taste changes; dry mouth | Location-specific; oral exam |
| Restless legs syndrome | Urge to move legs; worse at rest/night; relief with movement | Clinical criteria; may coexist with SFN |
| Vasculitic neuropathy | Asymmetric; mononeuritis multiplex pattern; systemic symptoms; rapid onset | Nerve biopsy; inflammatory markers; angiography |
| Paraneoplastic sensory ganglionopathy | Subacute onset; asymmetric; non-length-dependent; cancer history/risk | Anti-Hu antibodies; CT chest/abdomen/pelvis |

## APPENDIX A: SFN Diagnostic Criteria

### Clinical Features Suggesting SFN

| Symptom Category | Examples |
|------------------|----------|
| **Positive sensory symptoms** | Burning pain; electric shock sensations; tingling; allodynia; hyperalgesia |
| **Negative sensory symptoms** | Numbness; thermal hypoesthesia (can't feel hot/cold) |
| **Autonomic symptoms** | Dry eyes/mouth; sweating abnormalities; orthostatic intolerance; GI dysmotility; urinary dysfunction; erectile dysfunction |
| **Distribution** | Length-dependent (feet > hands) OR non-length-dependent (patchy, proximal, asymmetric) |

### Diagnostic Certainty Levels

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **Possible SFN** | Clinical symptoms and signs compatible with SFN |
| **Probable SFN** | Clinical features + abnormal QST thermal thresholds OR abnormal QSART |
| **Definite SFN** | Clinical features + reduced IENFD on skin biopsy below age/sex/site normative values |

### Length-Dependent vs Non-Length-Dependent (Ganglionopathy) Pattern

| Feature | Length-Dependent | Non-Length-Dependent |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| Distribution | Distal > proximal; symmetric; feet before hands | Patchy; asymmetric; proximal involvement; face/trunk |
| Common causes | Diabetes; metabolic; toxic; idiopathic | Sjogren's; paraneoplastic; autoimmune; amyloidosis |
| Prognosis | Often slowly progressive | May be more aggressive; depends on etiology |
| Workup focus | Metabolic causes | Autoimmune and systemic causes |

---

## APPENDIX B: Skin Biopsy Interpretation

### Procedure
- **Sites:** Distal leg (10 cm above lateral malleolus) and proximal thigh (20 cm below iliac spine)
- **Technique:** 3mm punch biopsy; send to laboratory with PGP9.5 immunostaining capability
- **Processing:** Fix in PLP or Zamboni's fixative; immunostain for PGP9.5

### Interpretation

| Result | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| IENFD below 5th percentile for age/sex/site | Diagnostic of SFN |
| IENFD at lower range of normal (5th-10th percentile) | Borderline; correlate clinically |
| Distal/proximal IENFD ratio >2:1 | Length-dependent pattern |
| Both sites equally reduced | Consider ganglionopathy or diffuse process |
| Sweat gland nerve fiber density reduced | Supports autonomic involvement |

### Normative Values (Approximate - Use Laboratory-Specific Norms)

| Site | Typical 5th Percentile Values |
|------|-------------------------------|
| Distal leg (age 20-40) | ~8-9 fibers/mm |
| Distal leg (age 60-80) | ~4-5 fibers/mm |
| Proximal thigh | Generally higher than distal leg |

---

## APPENDIX C: Autonomic Testing Interpretation

### QSART (Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test)

| Pattern | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Reduced sweat volume at distal sites (foot) with normal proximal | Length-dependent autonomic SFN |
| Globally reduced sweat volumes | Diffuse autonomic involvement |
| Normal QSART | Does not exclude SFN (may have sensory-predominant) |

### Autonomic Reflex Screen Components

| Test | What It Measures | Abnormality in SFN |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| QSART | Postganglionic sudomotor function | Reduced sweat volumes |
| Heart rate variability | Cardiovagal function | Reduced HRV to deep breathing |
| Valsalva maneuver | Cardiovagal and adrenergic function | Abnormal BP/HR response |
| Tilt table test | Adrenergic function; orthostatic tolerance | Orthostatic hypotension or POTS |

### POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) Criteria
- HR increase ≥30 bpm (or ≥40 bpm if age 12-19) within 10 minutes of standing
- Absence of orthostatic hypotension (SBP drop <20 mmHg)
- Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance
- Duration ≥6 months
