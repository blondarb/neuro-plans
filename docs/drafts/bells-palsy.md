# Bell's Palsy

**DIAGNOSIS:** Bell's Palsy (Idiopathic Facial Nerve Palsy)
**ICD-10:** G51.0 (Bell's palsy)
**SCOPE:** Acute unilateral peripheral facial nerve palsy of presumed idiopathic etiology. Covers initial evaluation, treatment, and follow-up. Excludes Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus), central facial palsy, bilateral facial palsy, and secondary causes.

**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

---

**CRITICAL: Time-Sensitive Treatment**
- Corticosteroids must be started within **72 hours** of symptom onset for maximum benefit
- Treatment initiated after 72 hours has significantly reduced efficacy
- House-Brackmann Grade V-VI (severe/complete paralysis) may benefit from adjunctive antiviral therapy

---

**RED FLAGS (Consider Alternative Diagnosis)**

| Red Flag | Concern | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Bilateral facial weakness | Lyme disease, GBS, sarcoidosis, leukemia | Comprehensive workup; do NOT assume Bell's palsy |
| Slow progression (>3 weeks) | Tumor, malignancy | MRI with contrast urgently |
| Recurrent facial palsy | Tumor, Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome | MRI; specialist referral |
| No improvement at 4 months | Incomplete recovery, synkinesis risk | EMG/NCS; consider referral |
| Facial twitching preceding weakness | Facial nerve tumor | MRI IAC/temporal bone |
| Other cranial nerve involvement | Brainstem lesion, skull base pathology | Urgent MRI/CT |
| Hyperacusis with vesicles in ear canal | Ramsay Hunt syndrome (VZV) | Treat as Ramsay Hunt (higher antiviral doses) |
| Systemic symptoms (rash, arthritis, tick exposure) | Lyme disease | Lyme serology |

## APPENDIX A: House-Brackmann Facial Nerve Grading Scale

| Grade | Description | Characteristics |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| I | Normal | Normal facial function in all areas |
| II | Mild dysfunction | Slight weakness noticeable on close inspection; may have very slight synkinesis; complete eye closure with minimal effort |
| III | Moderate dysfunction | Obvious but not disfiguring difference; noticeable but not severe synkinesis; complete eye closure with effort |
| IV | Moderately severe dysfunction | Obvious weakness and/or disfiguring asymmetry; incomplete eye closure |
| V | Severe dysfunction | Only barely perceptible motion; incomplete eye closure |
| VI | Total paralysis | No movement |

**Clinical Significance:**
- Grade I-II: Excellent prognosis; minimal treatment needed beyond eye protection
- Grade III-IV: Good prognosis with treatment; monitor for synkinesis
- Grade V-VI: Consider adjunctive antiviral therapy; ENoG may guide prognosis; higher risk of incomplete recovery

---

## APPENDIX B: Recovery Prognosis and Timeline

**Expected Recovery Timeline:**
- **Days 1-7:** Symptoms may worsen initially even with treatment
- **Weeks 1-3:** First signs of recovery typically appear
- **Weeks 3-8:** Significant improvement in most patients
- **Months 2-4:** Near-complete recovery in majority
- **Months 4-12:** Late recovery possible; synkinesis may develop

**Prognostic Factors:**

| Factor | Better Prognosis | Worse Prognosis |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Severity at onset | Incomplete paralysis (HB II-III) | Complete paralysis (HB V-VI) |
| Treatment timing | Steroids within 72 hours | Delayed treatment |
| Age | Younger patients | Older patients (>60) |
| Comorbidities | None | Diabetes, hypertension |
| Recovery onset | Within 3 weeks | After 4 months |
| ENoG findings | <90% degeneration | >90% degeneration |

**Overall Outcomes:**
- 70-85% of patients recover completely (HB I-II)
- 10-15% have mild residual weakness (HB III)
- 5-10% have moderate to severe residual weakness (HB IV-VI)
- ~16% develop synkinesis (involuntary facial movements)
- Recurrence rate: 7-12% (same or opposite side)

---

## APPENDIX C: Eye Protection Protocol

**Importance:** The inability to fully close the eye leads to corneal exposure, drying, and potential ulceration. Corneal injury is the most serious complication of Bell's palsy.

**Daytime Protocol:**
1. Artificial tears (preservative-free preferred): Every 1-2 hours while awake
2. Wear wrap-around glasses or moisture chamber when outdoors
3. Avoid fans, air conditioning directly on face
4. Blink consciously and frequently

**Nighttime Protocol:**
1. Apply lubricating ointment (e.g., Lacri-Lube) before bed
2. Tape eyelid closed using hypoallergenic tape (vertical strip from eyebrow to cheek)
3. Consider moisture chamber patch
4. Elevate head of bed slightly

**Warning Signs Requiring Urgent Ophthalmology:**
- Eye pain or foreign body sensation
- Eye redness
- Discharge from eye
- Vision changes or blurring
- Photophobia

**When to Consider Surgical Eye Protection:**
- Persistent lagophthalmos beyond 6-12 months
- Corneal breakdown despite medical management
- Options: Gold weight implant, tarsal strip, tarsorrhaphy
