# Paraneoplastic Neurological Syndrome

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** January 30, 2026
**REVISED:** January 30, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Paraneoplastic Neurological Syndrome

**ICD-10:** G13.0 (Paraneoplastic neuromyopathy and neuropathy), G13.1 (Other systemic atrophy primarily affecting CNS in neoplastic disease)

**SYNONYMS:** Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome, PNS, paraneoplastic syndrome, paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, PCD, paraneoplastic sensory neuropathy, paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus, anti-Hu syndrome, anti-Yo syndrome, anti-Ri syndrome, anti-CV2 syndrome, anti-amphiphysin syndrome, paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis, subacute cerebellar degeneration, subacute sensory neuronopathy, remote effect of cancer on nervous system

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis, cancer screening, immunotherapy, and symptom management of paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. Includes antibody panels (intracellular and cell-surface), malignancy workup (CT, PET-CT, organ-specific imaging), first-line immunotherapy (IV methylprednisolone, IVIG, PLEX), second-line immunosuppression (rituximab, cyclophosphamide), tumor-directed therapy coordination, and long-term monitoring. Covers key clinical phenotypes: limbic encephalitis, cerebellar degeneration, sensory neuropathy, opsoclonus-myoclonus, encephalomyelitis, and neuromuscular junction disorders. For autoimmune encephalitis with predominantly cell-surface antibodies (anti-NMDAR, LGI1, CASPR2), use "Autoimmune Encephalitis" template. For myasthenia gravis, use "Myasthenia Gravis" template. For Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, use dedicated LEMS template when available.

### 3A. Acute/Emergent

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |

*Note: Immunotherapy should be initiated as soon as paraneoplastic syndrome is clinically suspected. Do NOT wait for antibody results. The most critical intervention is identifying and treating the underlying tumor -- tumor-directed therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation) is the primary treatment and improves neurological outcomes. Cell-surface antibody syndromes are more responsive to immunotherapy than intracellular antibody syndromes.*

*Note: Symptomatic treatments provide supportive care while immunotherapy and tumor-directed therapy address the underlying cause. Avoid carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine if hyponatremia is present (common in paraneoplastic SIADH). Benzodiazepines are first-line for stiff-person spectrum disorders. Neuropathic pain management follows standard guidelines but may be refractory to conventional agents if the underlying tumor is not treated.*

*Note: Second-line therapy should be initiated if no improvement within 2-4 weeks of first-line therapy OR if clinically worsening. For intracellular antibody syndromes (anti-Hu, anti-Yo, anti-Ri), neurological prognosis is often poor despite aggressive immunotherapy -- tumor treatment remains the primary therapeutic intervention. For cell-surface antibody syndromes, escalation to rituximab is associated with improved outcomes. Cyclophosphamide is considered when rituximab fails or for aggressive intracellular antibody syndromes.*

|-----------|-------|------------|--------|---------------------------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Rituximab (maintenance) | IV | Long-term immunosuppression for relapse prevention in cell-surface antibody paraneoplastic syndromes | 500 mg :: IV :: q6 months :: 500-1000 mg IV every 6 months; re-dose based on CD19/CD20 B-cell repopulation or clinical relapse | Hepatitis B/C serology; quantitative immunoglobulins; CBC; LFTs; chest X-ray; TB screening (QuantiFERON); vaccinations current (no live vaccines within 4 weeks) | Active hepatitis B; severe active infection; live vaccines within 4 weeks; severe hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG <300) | CD19/CD20 counts q3 months; immunoglobulin levels q3-6 months; hepatitis B surveillance; infection monitoring; PML surveillance; CBC q3 months | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

| Oral prednisone (low-dose maintenance) | PO | Low-dose maintenance immunosuppression while steroid-sparing agent reaches full effect | 5 mg :: PO :: daily :: 5-10 mg PO daily; aim to taper off within 3-6 months if on steroid-sparing agent | Baseline glucose; BP; DEXA if anticipated use >3 months | Poorly controlled diabetes; active infection; avascular necrosis | Glucose; BP; bone density (DEXA if >3 months); weight; mood; cataracts; adrenal assessment on taper | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| IVIG (maintenance) | IV | Maintenance immunotherapy for partially responsive paraneoplastic syndrome; especially cell-surface antibody syndromes | 0.4 g/kg :: IV :: q4 weeks :: 0.4 g/kg IV every 4 weeks OR 1 g/kg IV every 4-6 weeks; adjust per response | IgA level; renal function; CBC; coagulation screen | IgA deficiency; thromboembolic history; renal failure | Renal function; headache; IgG trough levels; infusion reactions; thrombosis surveillance | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

*Note: Long-term immunosuppression is guided by antibody subtype, tumor status, and clinical response. Cell-surface antibody syndromes (anti-NMDAR, anti-LGI1, anti-CASPR2) are more amenable to chronic immunosuppression. Intracellular antibody syndromes (anti-Hu, anti-Yo) have limited benefit from maintenance immunotherapy once neuronal damage has occurred. Duration of therapy is individualized -- typically minimum 2 years for responsive syndromes. Monitor for immunosuppression-related complications (infection, secondary malignancy). Tumor surveillance must continue alongside immunosuppression.*

## CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT NOTES

### Antibody Classification and Prognostic Implications

**Intracellular (Onconeural) Antibodies -- T-cell mediated; poor neurological prognosis:**

| Antibody | Primary Syndrome | Most Common Tumor | Neurological Prognosis |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Anti-Hu (ANNA-1) | Encephalomyelitis, sensory neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy | SCLC (>90%) | Poor; often progressive despite treatment |
| Anti-Yo (PCA-1) | Cerebellar degeneration | Ovarian, breast cancer | Poor; irreversible Purkinje cell loss |
| Anti-Ri (ANNA-2) | Opsoclonus-myoclonus, brainstem encephalitis | Breast, SCLC | Moderate; some improvement with tumor treatment |
| Anti-CV2/CRMP5 | Encephalomyelitis, neuropathy, chorea, optic neuritis | SCLC, thymoma | Poor to moderate |
| Anti-amphiphysin | Stiff-person syndrome, encephalomyelitis | Breast, SCLC | Moderate; stiff-person may respond to IVIG |
| Anti-Ma2/Ta | Limbic/diencephalic encephalitis | Testicular germ cell, lung | Moderate; improves with tumor resection (young males) |

**Cell-Surface Antibodies -- Antibody-mediated; better treatment response:**

| Antibody | Primary Syndrome | Paraneoplastic Tumor (if any) | Neurological Prognosis |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| Anti-NMDAR | Encephalitis (psychosis, seizures, dyskinesias) | Ovarian teratoma (~40% females) | Good with immunotherapy + tumor resection |
| Anti-LGI1 | Limbic encephalitis, FBDS, hyponatremia | Thymoma (~5-10%) | Good with immunotherapy |
| Anti-CASPR2 | Limbic encephalitis, Morvan syndrome, neuromyotonia | Thymoma (~20-30%) | Good with immunotherapy |
| Anti-GABA-B | Limbic encephalitis with seizures | SCLC (~50%) | Moderate; depends on tumor response |
| Anti-AMPAR | Limbic encephalitis (relapsing) | Thymoma, lung, breast | Moderate; tends to relapse |
| Anti-VGCC (P/Q) | LEMS, cerebellar degeneration | SCLC (~60% of LEMS) | LEMS: good with treatment; cerebellar: poor |

### Key Clinical Principles

1. **Neurological symptoms often precede cancer diagnosis** -- in up to 70% of PNS cases, the neurological syndrome is the presenting feature
2. **Treat the tumor first** -- tumor-directed therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation) is the most important intervention for neurological improvement
3. **Cell-surface > intracellular for treatment response** -- syndromes mediated by cell-surface antibodies are more responsive to immunotherapy
4. **Repeat cancer screening** -- if initial screen is negative but paraneoplastic antibody is positive, repeat imaging q6 months for at least 2 years (up to 4 years for high-risk antibodies)
5. **Do NOT wait for antibody results** -- if clinical suspicion is high, initiate immunotherapy empirically
6. **Multidisciplinary approach** -- neurology, oncology, rehabilitation, and supportive care are all essential

- Removed multiple dose tiers from standard_dose field; starting dose used as standard_dose with titration in instructions
- Added CPT code for uric acid (CPT 84550) in Section 1A
- Added ICU column to Section 4B (Patient/Family Instructions) and Section 4C (Lifestyle & Prevention) for table consistency
- Fixed cross-reference "Same as PET/CT" in Section 2C FDG-PET brain row; replaced with explicit contraindications
- Fixed cross-reference "Same as first-line PLEX" in Section 3C Repeated PLEX row; replaced with explicit monitoring parameters
- Corrected Section 3D Oral prednisone row: moved contraindications from Pre-Treatment Requirements to Contraindications column; added proper pre-treatment requirements
- Corrected Section 3D Calcium + Vitamin D row: moved contraindications from Pre-Treatment Requirements to Contraindications column; added proper pre-treatment requirements
