### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Wear ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) during all walking to prevent tripping and ankle injury; remove only for bathing and sleeping | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Do not cross legs while sitting as this compresses the peroneal nerve at the fibular head and worsens injury | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid prolonged squatting, kneeling, or positions that put pressure on the outer knee area | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Perform ankle dorsiflexion and eversion exercises as instructed by physical therapist to maintain muscle strength during recovery | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Check lateral leg and foot daily for skin breakdown, especially if sensation is reduced; report any sores or ulcers | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Report worsening weakness (new difficulty lifting toes), spreading numbness, or pain to physician as this indicates progression requiring urgent re-evaluation | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Nerve recovery is slow (approximately 1 inch per month); improvement takes 6-12 months; maintain therapy and AFO use during this period | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid tight boots, stockings, or knee braces that compress the area below the outer knee | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Use caution on stairs and uneven surfaces; the AFO helps but does not fully replace normal ankle function | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| If diabetic, maintain strict blood sugar control as elevated glucose impairs nerve recovery | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Pad the lateral knee area when sleeping on the side; place a pillow between the legs | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Lose weight if overweight/obese; excess weight increases pressure on peripheral nerves and slows recovery | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid habitual leg crossing; this is the most common compressive cause of peroneal neuropathy ("crossed-leg palsy") | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Optimize glycemic control (HbA1c <7%) as diabetes impairs nerve recovery and increases vulnerability to compression | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Stop smoking to improve microvascular circulation and nerve healing | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Maintain adequate nutrition including B vitamins, protein, and micronutrients for nerve repair | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Wear appropriate footwear: avoid high-top boots or tight lace-up shoes that compress the dorsal foot (deep peroneal branch) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| For hospitalized patients: apply fibular head padding, reposition frequently, and avoid external compression to prevent iatrogenic peroneal neuropathy | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Implement fall prevention measures at home: remove loose rugs, ensure adequate lighting, install grab bars if balance impaired | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Notify surgical team of peroneal neuropathy risk during any planned lower extremity surgery, especially knee replacement or proximal fibula procedures | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

## APPENDIX A: Clinical Examination for Peroneal Neuropathy

### Motor Assessment

**Ankle Dorsiflexion (Deep Peroneal Nerve, L4-L5)**
- Technique: Patient dorsiflexes ankle against resistance
- MRC Grading: 0 = no contraction; 1 = flicker; 2 = movement with gravity eliminated; 3 = against gravity; 4 = against resistance; 5 = normal
- Clinical significance: Weakness confirms foot drop; degree helps grade severity

**Ankle Eversion (Superficial Peroneal Nerve, L5-S1)**
- Technique: Patient everts foot against resistance
- Clinical significance: Weakness of eversion plus dorsiflexion = common peroneal nerve at or above fibular head; preserved eversion with dorsiflexion weakness = deep peroneal branch only

**Toe Extension (Deep Peroneal Nerve, L5)**
- Technique: Patient extends toes (especially great toe via extensor hallucis longus) against resistance
- Clinical significance: Weakness in peroneal neuropathy and L5 radiculopathy; helps with localization combined with other findings

**Ankle Inversion (Tibial Nerve, L4-L5)**
- Technique: Patient inverts foot against resistance (tibialis posterior)
- Clinical significance: PRESERVED in peroneal neuropathy; WEAK in L5 radiculopathy (tibialis posterior receives L5 via tibial nerve); key differentiating test

**Hip Abduction (Superior Gluteal Nerve, L5)**
- Technique: Patient abducts hip against resistance (gluteus medius)
- Clinical significance: PRESERVED in peroneal neuropathy; WEAK in L5 radiculopathy; key differentiating test

### Sensory Assessment

**Lateral Leg (Superficial Peroneal Nerve)**
- Distribution: Lateral leg below knee
- Clinical significance: Involved in common peroneal neuropathy; spared in deep peroneal neuropathy

**Dorsal Foot (Superficial Peroneal Nerve)**
- Distribution: Dorsum of foot except first web space
- Clinical significance: Involved in common peroneal neuropathy

**First Web Space (Deep Peroneal Nerve)**
- Distribution: Small patch between first and second toes
- Clinical significance: Only sensory territory of deep peroneal nerve; isolated loss suggests deep peroneal branch lesion

### Tinel Sign at Fibular Head

- Technique: Tap over common peroneal nerve at the fibular head (posterolateral to fibular neck)
- Positive: Tingling or electric sensation radiating to lateral leg or dorsal foot
- Clinical significance: Suggests focal lesion at fibular head; helps localize compression site

### Key Differentiating Examination Findings

| Finding | Peroneal Neuropathy | L5 Radiculopathy | Sciatic Neuropathy |
|---------|:-------------------:|:-----------------:|:------------------:|
| Ankle dorsiflexion | Weak | Weak | Weak |
| Ankle eversion | Weak | May be weak | Weak |
| Ankle inversion | **Normal** | **Weak** | May be weak |
| Hip abduction | **Normal** | **Weak** | Normal |
| Plantar flexion | **Normal** | **Normal** | **Weak** |
| Knee flexion (hamstrings) | **Normal** | **Normal** | May be weak |
| Tinel at fibular head | Positive | Negative | Negative |
| Straight leg raise | Negative | May be positive | May be positive |
| Back pain | Absent | Present | May be present |
| Ankle reflex | Normal | Normal | May be reduced |

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## APPENDIX B: Electrodiagnostic Criteria for Peroneal Neuropathy

### Nerve Conduction Studies Protocol

**Motor Studies**
- Peroneal motor nerve: Record EDB; stimulate ankle, below fibular head, above fibular head, popliteal fossa
- Key finding: Conduction block or focal slowing across fibular head segment (>10 m/s drop or >50% amplitude drop)
- Tibial motor nerve: Record abductor hallucis; stimulate ankle, popliteal fossa (should be normal; rules out sciatic/plexus)

**Sensory Studies**
- Superficial peroneal sensory: Record lateral leg; stimulate calf
- Key finding: Normal SNAP amplitude in demyelinating lesion at fibular head; reduced/absent in axonal lesion or more distal lesion
- Sural sensory: Record lateral ankle (should be normal; rules out polyneuropathy)

### Electrodiagnostic Classification

| Severity | Motor NCS | Sensory NCS | EMG |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Mild (demyelinating) | Focal slowing or partial conduction block at fibular head; normal CMAP amplitude at ankle | Normal superficial peroneal SNAP | Normal or minimal denervation |
| Moderate (mixed) | Reduced CMAP amplitude at ankle; conduction block at fibular head | May be reduced | Denervation in peroneal-innervated muscles (tibialis anterior, peroneus longus) |
| Severe (axonal) | Absent or very low CMAP amplitude | Reduced or absent superficial peroneal SNAP | Active denervation (fibrillations, positive sharp waves) in tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, EDB; chronic changes |

### Key Electrodiagnostic Localizing Points

**Common Peroneal Neuropathy at Fibular Head:**
- Abnormal: Peroneal motor conduction across fibular head; tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, EDB on needle EMG
- Normal: Short head biceps femoris; tibialis posterior; gluteus medius; paraspinal muscles
- Normal: Tibial motor and sural sensory studies

**Sciatic Neuropathy (Peroneal Division):**
- Abnormal: Same as above PLUS short head biceps femoris on needle EMG
- Normal: Tibialis posterior; gluteus medius; paraspinal muscles

**L5 Radiculopathy:**
- Abnormal: Tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, tibialis posterior, gluteus medius; L5 paraspinal denervation possible
- Normal: Peroneal motor conduction across fibular head; peroneal SNAP
- Key distinguishing finding: Tibialis posterior and gluteus medius abnormal in L5 radiculopathy, NORMAL in peroneal neuropathy
