# Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Spells (PNES)

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** January 30, 2026
**REVISED:** January 30, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Spells (PNES)

**ICD-10:** F44.5 (Conversion disorder with seizures or convulsions)

**SYNONYMS:** Psychogenic non-epileptic spells, PNES, psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, psychogenic non-epileptic events, PNEE, dissociative seizures, functional seizures, non-epileptic attack disorder, NEAD, non-epileptic events, pseudoseizures (deprecated term), conversion disorder with seizures

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis, acute management, and long-term treatment of psychogenic non-epileptic spells (PNES). Covers the diagnostic workup including video-EEG confirmation, semiology features distinguishing PNES from epileptic seizures, diagnosis delivery as a therapeutic intervention, psychotherapy (CBT as evidence-based treatment), management of psychiatric comorbidities (PTSD, depression, anxiety), and anti-seizure medication taper. Addresses the ~10% of PNES patients with comorbid epilepsy. Settings: ED (acute event management), HOSP (video-EEG monitoring and diagnosis), OPD (long-term therapy and follow-up). ICU is generally NOT applicable for PNES. For epileptic seizures, see "New Onset Seizure" and "Status Epilepticus" templates. For the broader category of functional neurological disorder, see "FND" template.

## 1. LABORATORY WORKUP

### 1A. Essential/Core Labs

| Test | Rationale | Target Finding | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|------|-----------|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| CBC with differential (CPT 85025) | Baseline; rule out infection or anemia as contributor to altered consciousness | Normal | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | - |
| CMP (BMP + LFTs) (CPT 80053) | Metabolic encephalopathy screen; electrolyte abnormalities can provoke both epileptic and non-epileptic events | Normal | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | - |
| Blood glucose (CPT 82947) | Hypoglycemia as event mimic; altered consciousness differential | Normal (70-100 mg/dL) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | - |
| TSH (CPT 84443) | Thyroid dysfunction contributing to anxiety, mood disturbance, or tremor | Normal (0.4-4.0 mIU/L) | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Urinalysis (CPT 81003) | UTI as contributor to altered mental status; drug screen | Normal | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | - |
| Prolactin (15-20 min post-event) (CPT 84146) | Elevated >2x baseline supports epileptic seizure; NORMAL post-event supports PNES diagnosis; must be drawn within 10-20 min of event onset | Normal in PNES (elevated >2x baseline suggests epileptic seizure) | URGENT | URGENT | - | - |

*Note: The purpose of laboratory testing in suspected PNES is to exclude metabolic and toxic causes of paroxysmal events, NOT to diagnose PNES itself. PNES is diagnosed by video-EEG capture of a typical event with no epileptiform EEG correlate. Prolactin is most useful when drawn within 10-20 minutes of a convulsive event -- a normal prolactin supports but does NOT confirm PNES (sensitivity ~60% for GTC seizures).*

### 1B. Extended Workup (Second-line)

| Test | Rationale | Target Finding | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|------|-----------|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Urine drug screen (CPT 80307) | Substance intoxication/withdrawal as event precipitant; establish baseline for psychiatric treatment | Negative (document for differential) | STAT | STAT | - | - |
| ESR (CPT 85652) | Inflammatory screen if autoimmune etiology suspected | Normal | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| CRP (CPT 86140) | Inflammatory screen if autoimmune or infectious etiology suspected | Normal | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Vitamin B12 (CPT 82607) | B12 deficiency contributing to neuropsychiatric symptoms | Normal (>300 pg/mL) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| HbA1c (CPT 83036) | Diabetic neuropathy or metabolic contributor; baseline for psychiatric medication management | Normal (<5.7%) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Serum anti-seizure medication levels (CPT 80184/80185/80177) | If patient on ASMs, verify compliance and levels before diagnosing "breakthrough seizures" as PNES | Therapeutic (varies by drug) | URGENT | URGENT | ROUTINE | - |

*Note: Anti-seizure medication levels are important when a patient on established ASMs presents with events -- subtherapeutic levels may indicate noncompliance as a cause of epileptic breakthrough, while therapeutic levels in a patient with events consistent with PNES support the functional diagnosis.*

### 1C. Rare/Specialized

| Test | Rationale | Target Finding | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|------|-----------|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Autoimmune encephalitis antibody panel (serum and CSF) | If acute onset with psychiatric features, movement disorder, or cognitive decline suggestive of anti-NMDAR encephalitis | Negative | - | EXT | EXT | - |
| Paraneoplastic antibody panel | If atypical features or suspicion for paraneoplastic neurological syndrome | Negative | - | EXT | EXT | - |
| Cortisol (AM) (CPT 82533) | Adrenal insufficiency presenting as recurrent syncope-like episodes | Normal (6-23 mcg/dL AM) | - | EXT | EXT | - |

## 2. DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING & STUDIES

### 2A. Essential/First-line

| Study | Timing | Target Finding | Contraindications | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-------|--------|----------------|-------------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| CT head without contrast (CPT 70450) | ED triage for first-time event or atypical features | Normal; rules out hemorrhage, mass, or acute structural lesion | None significant | STAT | STAT | - | - |
| Routine EEG (CPT 95816) | Baseline interictal recording; screens for epileptiform abnormalities | Normal interictal EEG supports PNES (but does NOT exclude comorbid epilepsy) | None significant | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Video-EEG monitoring (prolonged) (CPT 95711-95720) | GOLD STANDARD for PNES diagnosis; capture habitual event with simultaneous EEG showing no epileptiform correlate | Normal EEG during clinically typical event = definitive PNES diagnosis (ILAE diagnostic certainty level: "documented") | None significant | - | URGENT | ROUTINE | - |
| MRI brain with and without contrast (CPT 70553) | Rule out structural lesion; required to exclude epileptogenic pathology, especially if comorbid epilepsy suspected | Normal (no epileptogenic lesion) | Standard MRI contraindications (pacemaker, metallic implants) | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

*Note: Video-EEG monitoring (vEEG) with capture of a habitual event is the DIAGNOSTIC GOLD STANDARD. The ILAE defines diagnostic certainty levels: (1) "Possible" = clinical history alone; (2) "Probable" = witnessed by clinician with semiology features; (3) "Clinically established" = vEEG without event capture but interictal and other data support; (4) "Documented" = vEEG captures typical event with no ictal EEG correlate. ALWAYS aim for "documented" level when possible. Note: ~5% of frontal lobe seizures may not produce clear scalp EEG changes -- clinical correlation essential.*

### 2B. Extended

| Study | Timing | Target Finding | Contraindications | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-------|--------|----------------|-------------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Ambulatory EEG (24-72 hours) (CPT 95711) | If events too infrequent for inpatient vEEG; outpatient alternative | Capture event with no EEG correlate | None significant | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| MRI brain with epilepsy protocol (CPT 70553) | If comorbid epilepsy suspected (thin cuts through hippocampi, 3T preferred) | Normal or identifies epileptogenic lesion in dual-diagnosis patients | Standard MRI contraindications | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| ECG/Holter monitor (CPT 93000/93224) | If syncope in differential; arrhythmia as event mimic | Normal | None significant | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Tilt table test (CPT 95921) | If vasovagal syncope suspected as alternative or comorbid diagnosis | Normal or positive (identifies syncope component) | Severe aortic stenosis; recent MI | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 2C. Rare/Specialized

## 3. TREATMENT

### 3A. Acute/Emergent (Event Management in ED)

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Verbal reassurance and grounding techniques (first-line) | - | Active PNES event; first-line acute management | N/A :: - :: - :: Use calm, reassuring voice; say "You are safe, I am here to help you"; guide grounding (name 5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you touch); do NOT restrain, force oral airway, or attempt IV access during event | None | Event duration; response to verbal cues; vital signs; document semiology features | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | - |
| Withhold IV benzodiazepines | - | Do NOT administer benzodiazepines for confirmed or suspected PNES; benzodiazepines cause respiratory depression without benefit; leading cause of iatrogenic intubation in PNES | N/A :: - :: - :: Withhold lorazepam, midazolam, diazepam; if epileptic seizure cannot be excluded, treat per status epilepticus protocol while awaiting clarification | If epileptic seizure cannot be excluded, treat as epileptic until proven otherwise | Respiratory status; level of consciousness; document clinical features to aid differentiation | STAT | STAT | - | - |
| Withhold IV anti-seizure medications | - | Do NOT load IV phenytoin, levetiracetam, or valproate for confirmed or suspected PNES; ineffective and delays correct diagnosis | N/A :: - :: - :: Withhold IV ASM loading; if comorbid epilepsy is established and epileptic seizure possible, continue home ASMs | Comorbid epilepsy with possible epileptic breakthrough | Document event semiology; EEG if available | STAT | STAT | - | - |
| Nasal ammonia capsule (smelling salts) | INH | Functional unresponsiveness; aids differentiation from epileptic postictal state | 1 capsule :: INH :: PRN :: Break capsule 6 inches from nose; grimace or withdrawal response confirms awareness and supports functional diagnosis | None significant | Response to stimulation; document findings | STAT | STAT | - | - |
| Supportive safety measures | - | Injury prevention during active PNES event | N/A :: - :: - :: Place patient in safe position; pad side rails if in bed; remove nearby sharp objects; do NOT insert bite block or tongue blade; position on side if secretions present | None | Injury check post-event; vital signs | STAT | STAT | - | - |

*Note: CRITICAL -- The most common iatrogenic harm in PNES is inappropriate treatment with IV benzodiazepines and ASM loading, leading to respiratory depression, intubation, and ICU admission. Recognizing PNES features during the event (eyes closed, asynchronous movements, waxing-waning, prolonged duration >2 min, side-to-side head movements, preserved awareness during bilateral motor activity) is the most important acute intervention. If there is ANY doubt about whether an event is epileptic, treat as epileptic until clarified -- safety first.*

### 3B. Diagnosis Delivery ("The Name")

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Structured diagnosis delivery session | - | All PNES patients after diagnostic confirmation; the single most important therapeutic intervention | N/A :: - :: - :: Explain: "You have a condition called functional seizures (or non-epileptic events). These are REAL events, not fabricated. Your brain is sending the wrong signals, like a software glitch rather than hardware damage. The good news is this is treatable." Show the patient their vEEG results (normal EEG during event). Use the term "functional seizures" rather than "psychogenic" if patient prefers. Validate the reality of symptoms. Express diagnostic confidence. Emphasize treatability. Provide neurosymptoms.org | None | Patient understanding and acceptance; emotional response; therapeutic alliance; repeat key messages across multiple encounters if needed | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | - |

*Note: HOW the diagnosis is communicated is the single most important predictor of treatment engagement and outcome. Key principles: (1) Use clear, non-judgmental language; (2) Avoid "psychogenic" in patient-facing communication if it causes stigma -- "functional seizures" is preferred by patients; (3) Show the vEEG evidence to the patient; (4) Explain the diagnosis is made based on WHAT THE EVENTS ARE (functional), not what they are NOT (not epileptic); (5) Express confidence -- uncertainty from the physician leads to patient disengagement; (6) NEVER say "there is nothing wrong with you" or "it's all in your head"; (7) Frame as the beginning of treatment, not the end of the diagnostic journey. See Appendix A for a diagnosis delivery script.*

### 3C. Psychotherapy (Primary Treatment)

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Cognitive Behavioral Therapy -- PNES-specific (CBT-PNES) | - | All PNES patients; strongest evidence base (CODES trial); addresses illness beliefs, avoidance, seizure-related cognitions, and perpetuating factors | 12-16 sessions :: - :: weekly :: Weekly 50-60 min sessions; PNES-specific CBT model per Goldstein et al. (CODES trial); includes psychoeducation, seizure control techniques, cognitive restructuring of illness beliefs, graded behavioral activation, addressing avoidance, trauma processing if indicated; booster sessions at 3 and 6 months | Active psychosis; severe intellectual disability preventing engagement; active substance dependence (treat first) | Seizure/event frequency diary; PHQ-9; GAD-7; functional measures; treatment engagement | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) | - | PNES with PTSD or significant trauma history (present in ~30-50% of patients) | 8-12 sessions :: - :: weekly :: Standard EMDR protocol; 60-90 min sessions; process traumatic memories identified as precipitating or perpetuating PNES; may be combined with CBT | Active psychosis; severe dissociative disorder (requires specialist modification); acute suicidality | PCL-5 (PTSD scale); event frequency; dissociation measures (DES); treatment engagement | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Psychodynamic psychotherapy | - | PNES with prominent interpersonal difficulties, attachment disturbance, or alexithymia (difficulty identifying emotions) | 6-12 months :: - :: weekly :: Explore unconscious conflicts, emotional processing difficulties, and relational patterns contributing to PNES; helps patients connect emotional states to physical symptoms | Active psychosis; severe personality disorder (relative contraindication) | Event frequency; functional measures; therapeutic alliance assessment; emotional awareness | - | - | EXT | - |
| Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) | - | PNES with high anxiety, somatic hypervigilance, or as adjunct to CBT | 8-week program :: - :: weekly :: Standard 8-week MBSR program; weekly 2.5-hour sessions plus home practice; body scan modified to reduce somatic hypervigilance; focus on non-reactive awareness of body sensations | None significant | GAD-7; mindfulness measures (FFMQ); event frequency; patient-reported stress | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Group psychoeducation | - | All PNES patients; normalizes experience, reduces isolation, provides peer support | 6-8 sessions :: - :: weekly :: Structured group program (6-10 participants); covers PNES education, coping strategies, trigger identification, self-management skills, grounding techniques, relapse prevention | None significant | Attendance; knowledge assessment; patient satisfaction; event frequency | - | - | ROUTINE | - |

*Note: CBT specifically adapted for PNES (CBT-PNES) has the strongest evidence base, demonstrated in the CODES trial (Goldstein et al. Lancet Psychiatry 2020) -- the largest RCT in PNES treatment. CBT-PNES reduced seizure frequency and improved quality of life. Finding a therapist experienced with PNES/functional neurological disorders is critical -- generic CBT without PNES-specific modifications is less effective. The CODES trial manual is available as a guide for therapists.*

### 3D. Pharmacologic Management of Psychiatric Comorbidities

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|

| Venlafaxine XR | PO | Comorbid depression with prominent anxiety; chronic pain comorbidity (dual SNRI benefit); alternative when SSRIs ineffective | 37.5 mg :: PO :: daily :: Start 37.5 mg daily x 1 week; titrate by 37.5-75 mg q1wk; max 225 mg/day; MUST taper to discontinue (severe discontinuation syndrome) | Uncontrolled hypertension; concurrent MAOIs; narrow-angle glaucoma | BP (dose-dependent hypertension); HR; serotonin syndrome; discontinuation syndrome risk (taper over 2-4 weeks) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Duloxetine | PO | Comorbid depression with chronic pain (common in PNES); fibromyalgia comorbidity | 30 mg :: PO :: daily :: Start 30 mg daily x 1 week; increase to 60 mg daily; max 120 mg/day | Hepatic impairment (CrCl <30); concurrent MAOIs; uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma | LFTs; BP; serotonin syndrome; discontinuation syndrome (taper slowly) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Prazosin | PO | PTSD-related nightmares and sleep disruption (common in PNES patients with trauma history) | 1 mg :: PO :: qHS :: Start 1 mg PO qHS; titrate by 1-2 mg q1wk; max 15 mg qHS; monitor for first-dose hypotension (give first dose at bedtime) | Hypotension; concurrent PDE5 inhibitors | Orthostatic BP (especially first dose); dizziness; syncope; nightmare frequency | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

*Note: There is NO medication that directly treats PNES. Pharmacotherapy targets COMORBID psychiatric conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD, insomnia) that are highly prevalent in PNES and perpetuate events. CRITICAL: Avoid benzodiazepines (alprazolam, lorazepam, clonazepam) -- they do NOT reduce PNES events, carry addiction risk, and may worsen dissociation. If the patient is already on chronic benzodiazepines, a slow supervised taper is recommended.*

### 3E. Anti-Seizure Medication Taper

| Treatment | Route | Indication | Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Gradual ASM taper -- levetiracetam | PO | Confirmed PNES on levetiracetam without comorbid epilepsy; taper AFTER definitive vEEG diagnosis | 250-500 mg reduction :: PO :: q2wk :: Taper by 250-500 mg every 2 weeks; typical taper from 1000 mg BID over 8-12 weeks; monitor for anxiety/mood changes (levetiracetam withdrawal can worsen mood) | Comorbid epilepsy confirmed or suspected (~10% dual diagnosis); do NOT taper without epileptologist input in dual-diagnosis patients | Event frequency diary; mood (levetiracetam withdrawal may improve mood or cause rebound anxiety); verify no epileptiform events during taper | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Gradual ASM taper -- lamotrigine | PO | Confirmed PNES on lamotrigine without comorbid epilepsy | 25-50 mg reduction :: PO :: q2wk :: Taper by 25-50 mg every 2 weeks; slower taper than other ASMs (lamotrigine has mood-stabilizing properties -- monitor for mood destabilization) | Comorbid epilepsy; bipolar disorder (lamotrigine may be serving as mood stabilizer) | Event frequency; mood stability (PHQ-9, mood diary); rash (rare during taper but document) | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Gradual ASM taper -- valproic acid | PO | Confirmed PNES on valproic acid without comorbid epilepsy | 250 mg reduction :: PO :: q2wk :: Taper by 250 mg every 2 weeks; monitor for mood changes (valproate has mood-stabilizing properties); check levels during taper if comorbid epilepsy cannot be fully excluded | Comorbid epilepsy; bipolar disorder (valproate may be serving as mood stabilizer) | Event frequency; mood; weight (may lose weight with taper); LFTs; tremor (may improve with taper) | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Gradual ASM taper -- carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine | PO | Confirmed PNES on carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine without comorbid epilepsy | 100-200 mg reduction :: PO :: q2wk :: Taper by 100-200 mg every 2 weeks; carbamazepine induces its own metabolism (levels may shift during taper); complete taper over 8-12 weeks | Comorbid epilepsy; trigeminal neuralgia (carbamazepine may be treating pain) | Event frequency; mood; sodium level (hyponatremia more common with oxcarbazepine -- may resolve with taper); CBC | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Gradual ASM taper -- topiramate | PO | Confirmed PNES on topiramate without comorbid epilepsy | 25-50 mg reduction :: PO :: q1-2wk :: Taper by 25-50 mg every 1-2 weeks; cognitive side effects may improve with taper; monitor for weight changes | Comorbid epilepsy; migraine prophylaxis (topiramate may be treating migraines -- assess before taper) | Event frequency; cognitive function (may improve); weight; migraine frequency if history of headache | - | - | ROUTINE | - |
| Gradual ASM taper -- phenobarbital | PO | Confirmed PNES on phenobarbital without comorbid epilepsy; REQUIRES SLOW TAPER (barbiturate withdrawal risk) | 15-30 mg reduction :: PO :: q2-4wk :: Taper by 15-30 mg every 2-4 weeks; VERY SLOW taper over 3-6 months; barbiturate withdrawal can cause TRUE seizures even in non-epileptic patients; inpatient monitoring may be needed for high doses | Comorbid epilepsy; barbiturate dependence (consider inpatient taper for high doses >120 mg/day) | Event frequency; withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, insomnia, tremor, TRUE seizures); vital signs during taper; may need phenobarbital levels | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

*Note: CRITICAL SAFETY ISSUE -- Approximately 10% of PNES patients have COMORBID epilepsy (dual diagnosis). ASM taper should ONLY be performed after definitive vEEG diagnosis and assessment for dual diagnosis. If there is ANY suspicion of comorbid epilepsy, do NOT taper ASMs without epileptologist input. Taper one drug at a time. Special caution with phenobarbital and benzodiazepines -- withdrawal from these agents can provoke true epileptic seizures even in non-epileptic patients. The ASM taper should be explained to the patient as part of the treatment plan, emphasizing that these medications were prescribed based on earlier understanding and that stopping them is POSITIVE (removing unnecessary medication burden).*

### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Your events are REAL -- they are caused by your brain sending the wrong signals, like a software problem rather than structural brain damage, and they are NOT fabricated or imagined | Y | Y | Y |
| The good news is that functional seizures are TREATABLE -- many patients improve significantly or become event-free with the right therapy | Y | Y | Y |
| Visit www.neurosymptoms.org for reliable, expert-written information about functional seizures (recommended by leading neurologists worldwide) | Y | Y | Y |
| Anti-seizure medications do NOT work for functional seizures -- your neurologist will work with you to safely taper these medications if you are taking them | - | Y | Y |
| Do NOT take extra doses of anti-seizure medication during or after an event -- this will NOT help and may cause side effects | Y | Y | Y |
| During an event, use grounding techniques: focus on your surroundings, name objects you see, feel textures in your hands, listen to sounds around you -- these techniques can help shorten events | - | Y | Y |
| Family members and caregivers: during an event, stay calm, speak reassuringly, do NOT restrain or force anything into the mouth, time the event, and do NOT call 911 unless there is injury or the event is clearly different from usual | Y | Y | Y |
| Keep a seizure diary recording event frequency, duration, possible triggers (stress, sleep deprivation, conflict), and context to help identify patterns | - | Y | Y |
| Attend ALL recommended therapy appointments (psychology and physiotherapy are the primary treatments -- more important than any medication) | - | Y | Y |
| Return to the ED only for events that are clearly DIFFERENT from your usual events, for injury during an event, or for new symptoms such as sudden severe headache, fever, or one-sided weakness | Y | Y | Y |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Regular aerobic exercise (30 minutes, 5 days per week) to reduce stress, improve mood, and support overall brain health | - | Y | Y |
| Sleep hygiene: consistent bed and wake times, 7-9 hours nightly, avoid screens 1 hour before bed, limit caffeine after noon (sleep deprivation is a common PNES trigger) | - | Y | Y |
| Stress management: identify and address major stressors; use breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness daily | - | Y | Y |
| Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs (lower event threshold, worsen mood and anxiety, interfere with therapy) | - | Y | Y |
| Avoid benzodiazepines for anxiety (not helpful for PNES, can worsen dissociation, and carry addiction risk) -- discuss non-benzodiazepine alternatives with your provider | - | Y | Y |
| Pacing: balance activity and rest throughout the day to avoid the "boom-bust" cycle (overexertion on good days leads to increased events on subsequent days) | - | Y | Y |
| Maintain social connections and meaningful activities to prevent isolation, which worsens PNES outcomes | - | Y | Y |
| Driving restrictions: follow state-specific regulations for seizure-like events; most states require a seizure-free interval (varies by state) -- discuss with your neurologist | - | Y | Y |

|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Epileptic seizures (generalized tonic-clonic) | Stereotyped semiology; eyes OPEN (~95%); postictal confusion (>5 min); tonic-clonic evolution; tongue lateral bite; incontinence; duration typically <3 min | Video-EEG with event capture (gold standard); prolactin level (elevated >2x post-GTC); MRI brain |
| Epileptic seizures (frontal lobe) | Bizarre motor automatisms; brief (<30 sec); stereotyped; nocturnal predominance; may not show surface EEG changes | Video-EEG (may need intracranial monitoring); MRI brain with epilepsy protocol; seizure semiology analysis |
| Vasovagal syncope | Triggered by prolonged standing, pain, or emotional stress; prodrome (lightheadedness, diaphoresis, tunnel vision); brief loss of consciousness; rapid recovery; no postictal confusion | Tilt table test; ECG; history and trigger identification |
| Cardiac arrhythmia (syncope) | Sudden onset without prodrome; associated with palpitations; may occur during exertion; family history of sudden death | ECG; Holter/event monitor; echocardiogram; cardiac electrophysiology study |
| Panic attacks | Sudden onset fear; palpitations; chest pain; dyspnea; paresthesias; derealization; duration 10-30 min; preserved consciousness | Clinical history; GAD-7/PHQ-9; panic typically does not involve rhythmic movements or unresponsiveness |
| Transient ischemic attack | Sudden focal neurological deficit; duration <24 hours; vascular risk factors; arterial territory distribution | MRI brain (DWI); CT angiography; vascular risk factor assessment |
| Paroxysmal movement disorders (dystonia, dyskinesia) | Brief, stereotyped movement episodes; may be triggered by sudden movement (kinesigenic); genetic basis; responsive to carbamazepine (kinesigenic type) | Genetic testing (PRRT2 for PKD); clinical semiology; family history; treatment trial |
| Migraine with aura | Visual or sensory aura with gradual spread; followed by headache; duration 5-60 min for aura; episodic | Clinical history; headache diary; MRI brain to rule out structural lesion |
| Hypoglycemia | Diaphoresis; tremor; confusion; pallor; triggered by fasting or insulin administration; rapid resolution with glucose | Blood glucose during event; continuous glucose monitoring; HbA1c |
| Sleep disorders (narcolepsy, cataplexy) | Excessive daytime sleepiness; cataplexy triggered by emotion (laughter, surprise); sleep paralysis; hypnagogic hallucinations | Polysomnography; MSLT (mean sleep latency test); CSF hypocretin level |
| Factitious disorder / malingering | Intentional symptom production; external motivation in malingering, sick role in factitious; VERY RARE -- do NOT assume | No reliable test; clinical judgment; inconsistency with incentives; PNES is NOT malingering or factitious |

*Note: PNES frequently COEXISTS with organic neurological disease. Approximately 10% of PNES patients also have comorbid epilepsy. The presence of an organic diagnosis does NOT exclude PNES, and the presence of PNES does NOT exclude organic disease. Always evaluate for dual diagnosis.*

## CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT NOTES

### Semiology: PNES vs. Epileptic Seizures

| Feature | Favors PNES | Favors Epileptic Seizure |
|---------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Eyes during event | Closed (strongly suggests PNES) | Open (~95% of epileptic seizures) |
| Head movement | Side-to-side | Tonic deviation to one side |
| Limb movements | Asynchronous; thrashing; out-of-phase | Synchronous tonic-clonic evolution |
| Duration | Prolonged (>2 min; often >5 min) | Brief (<3 min for GTC) |
| Course | Waxing and waning; stops and starts | Stereotyped evolution (tonic then clonic) |
| Pelvic thrusting | Suggestive (but not pathognomonic) | Rare (possible in frontal lobe seizures) |
| Vocalization | Crying; talking during event | Ictal cry at onset; no speech during GTC |
| Awareness during bilateral motor activity | Preserved awareness possible | Always impaired during bilateral convulsive seizure |
| Postictal state | Rapid reorientation; may have prolonged pseudocoma | Prolonged confusion (>5 min); gradual recovery |
| Tongue bite | Absent or tip of tongue | Lateral tongue bite (highly specific for epileptic) |
| Incontinence | Possible (non-specific) | Common (non-specific) |
| Recall of event | Often present; may recall conversations during event | Absent for GTC; partial for focal aware seizures |
| Nocturnal events | Rare; events arise from wakefulness | Common; arise from sleep |
| Stereotypy | Variable between events | Highly stereotyped from event to event |

### Diagnosis Delivery Script (Suggested Framework)

1. **Validate:** "I want you to know that your symptoms are REAL. I believe you."
2. **Name:** "Based on the testing we have done, including the video-EEG recording, your events are caused by a condition called functional seizures."
3. **Explain:** "Your brain is misfiring -- like a software problem rather than a hardware problem. The brain structures are healthy, but the signals are not working correctly."
4. **Show evidence:** "During your event, your brain waves (EEG) remained completely normal. This tells us the events are not caused by abnormal electrical discharges like in epilepsy."
5. **Treat:** "The good news is that this condition is treatable. The most effective treatment is a specific type of therapy called CBT, which helps retrain how your brain processes stress and emotions."
6. **Empower:** "Many patients improve significantly. You have an active role in your recovery."
7. **Resource:** "I recommend visiting www.neurosymptoms.org for excellent patient information about this condition."

### Common Pitfalls in PNES Management

| Pitfall | Consequence | Correct Approach |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| Treating PNES events with IV benzodiazepines | Respiratory depression; intubation; ICU admission | Verbal reassurance; grounding; supportive measures only |
| Loading IV anti-seizure medications | Unnecessary side effects; delays diagnosis; reinforces epilepsy misdiagnosis | Withhold ASM loading; pursue vEEG for definitive diagnosis |
| "There's nothing wrong with you" | Damages therapeutic alliance; patient seeks care elsewhere; delays recovery | "This is a REAL condition called functional seizures" |
| Diagnosis of exclusion approach | Delays diagnosis by months-years; excessive testing reinforces illness behavior | Use positive clinical signs and vEEG for positive diagnosis |
| Not tapering ASMs after diagnosis | Unnecessary medication burden; side effects; reinforces epilepsy label | Gradual supervised taper after definitive diagnosis |
| Referring to psychiatry without explanation | Patient feels dismissed; disengages from care | Explain multidisciplinary model; psychiatry treats comorbidities as part of the team |
| Over-investigating after diagnosis is established | Reinforces doubt; iatrogenic harm; delays treatment | Targeted testing only if new symptoms are clearly different from established PNES |

## APPENDIX A: Diagnosis Delivery Communication Guide

### Before the Conversation
- Review vEEG results and confirm the diagnosis
- Schedule adequate time (at least 20-30 minutes)
- Include family members/support persons if the patient agrees
- Have written materials and neurosymptoms.org address ready

### During the Conversation
1. Start with validation: acknowledge symptoms are real and distressing
2. Present the diagnosis name clearly: "functional seizures" (preferred) or "non-epileptic events"
3. Use the "software vs. hardware" analogy: the brain's structure is normal, but the signaling is disrupted
4. Show the vEEG evidence: walk the patient through their normal EEG during a captured event
5. Explain what this MEANS, not just what it IS NOT: avoid defining PNES only as "not epilepsy"
6. Discuss treatment options: CBT is the evidence-based treatment; medications for comorbidities
7. Address common fears: "Am I crazy?" (No -- this is a neurological condition); "Will I get better?" (Many patients improve significantly with treatment)
8. Provide resources: neurosymptoms.org, support groups (FND Hope), written summary of the diagnosis

### After the Conversation
- Provide a written summary of the diagnosis for the patient
- Send a copy of the diagnosis to the primary care provider with clear terminology
- Schedule follow-up within 2-4 weeks to reinforce the message
- Arrange therapy referrals promptly (CBT should start within 1-2 weeks if possible)
- Expect that patients may need the diagnosis explained multiple times -- this is normal

### Common Patient Questions and Suggested Responses

| Question | Suggested Response |
|----------|-------------------|
| "Are you saying it's all in my head?" | "No. Your symptoms are real. Your brain is real. The problem is in how your brain processes and sends signals, not in your imagination." |
| "Does this mean I'm faking?" | "Absolutely not. Functional seizures are involuntary. You cannot control them any more than someone with epilepsy can control their seizures." |
| "Why is this happening to me?" | "Functional seizures often develop in people who have experienced stress, trauma, or other medical conditions. Your brain developed this pattern of responding, and therapy can help retrain it." |
| "Will I ever get better?" | "Yes, many patients improve significantly with the right treatment. CBT has been shown in research studies to reduce event frequency." |
| "Should I stop my seizure medications?" | "We will work together to safely taper those medications over time, since they do not help with functional seizures. This is done gradually and under supervision." |
