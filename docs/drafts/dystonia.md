## APPENDIX A: DYSTONIA CLASSIFICATION

### By Body Distribution

| Type | Definition | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| Focal | Single body region | Cervical (torticollis), blepharospasm, writer's cramp, laryngeal |
| Segmental | Two or more contiguous regions | Cranial-cervical (Meige + cervical), brachial |
| Multifocal | Two or more non-contiguous regions | Blepharospasm + writer's cramp |
| Hemidystonia | Ipsilateral arm and leg | Usually secondary (stroke, tumor) |
| Generalized | Trunk + at least 2 other regions | DYT1 dystonia, Wilson's disease |

### By Etiology (Axis 2)

| Category | Subtype | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Inherited | Isolated dystonia | DYT1 (TOR1A), DYT6 (THAP1) |
| Inherited | Combined dystonia | DYT5 (GCH1, dopa-responsive), myoclonus-dystonia (SGCE) |
| Inherited | Complex dystonia | Wilson's disease, NBIA, Huntington's disease |
| Acquired | Perinatal injury | Cerebral palsy with dystonia |
| Acquired | Drugs | Tardive dystonia, acute dystonic reaction |
| Acquired | Structural | Stroke, tumor, demyelination |
| Acquired | Autoimmune | Anti-NMDAR encephalitis, paraneoplastic |
| Idiopathic | Sporadic | Adult-onset focal dystonia (most cervical) |
| Idiopathic | Familial | Family history without identified gene |

## APPENDIX B: SENSORY TRICKS (GESTE ANTAGONISTE)

Sensory tricks are voluntary maneuvers that temporarily reduce dystonic posturing. Their presence supports the diagnosis of primary dystonia.

### Common Sensory Tricks by Type

| Dystonia Type | Common Sensory Tricks |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Cervical dystonia | Light touch to chin, cheek, or back of head; leaning against wall; wearing cervical collar |
| Blepharospasm | Touching eyelid or brow; wearing dark glasses; pulling eyelid skin; singing or humming |
| Writer's cramp | Using thicker pen; changing grip; writing on different surface |
| Oromandibular | Chewing gum; touching lips; biting on object |

### Clinical Significance

- Present in ~70-80% of cervical dystonia patients
- Absence does not exclude diagnosis
- Diminish over time in some patients
- May be used therapeutically (collar, glasses)
