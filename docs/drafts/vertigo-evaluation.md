## APPENDIX A: HINTS Exam Protocol

### HINTS Examination for Acute Vestibular Syndrome

The **HINTS** exam differentiates peripheral from central causes of acute vertigo with higher sensitivity than early MRI for posterior circulation stroke.

**When to Use:** Acute continuous vertigo with nystagmus (Acute Vestibular Syndrome)

**H - Head Impulse Test (HIT)**
1. Patient fixes gaze on examiner's nose
2. Rapidly turn head 10-20 degrees to each side
3. **Peripheral:** Catch-up saccade when turning toward affected ear (abnormal/positive)
4. **Central:** No catch-up saccade (normal/negative) - concerning for stroke

**I - Nystagmus**
1. Observe spontaneous nystagmus
2. Note direction and whether it changes with gaze direction
3. **Peripheral:** Unidirectional, horizontal (may have torsional component), suppresses with fixation
4. **Central:** Direction-changing, purely vertical, or purely torsional - concerning for stroke

**N - Test of Skew (Alternate Cover Test)**
1. Cover one eye, then uncover and cover the other
2. Watch for vertical refixation movement
3. **Peripheral:** No skew deviation
4. **Central:** Skew deviation present - concerning for stroke

### HINTS Interpretation

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Abnormal HIT + Unidirectional nystagmus + No skew | **PERIPHERAL** - Likely vestibular neuritis |
| Normal HIT + Direction-changing nystagmus OR Skew present | **CENTRAL** - Requires urgent MRI; high stroke probability |
| Any ONE central sign | Treat as CENTRAL until proven otherwise |

### HINTS-Plus

Add **hearing assessment** (finger rub test or audiometry):
- New unilateral hearing loss with acute vertigo suggests **AICA stroke** (anterior inferior cerebellar artery)
- Presence of hearing loss with "peripheral" HINTS pattern should still raise concern for stroke

### Key Points

- HINTS is **more sensitive than early MRI** for posterior circulation stroke (sensitivity 100% vs 72% for MRI within 48 hours)
- Only valid in **Acute Vestibular Syndrome** (acute, continuous vertigo with nystagmus)
- **Not valid for episodic vertigo** (e.g., BPPV) or chronic dizziness
- Requires practice to perform reliably; video-HIT more accurate than bedside

## APPENDIX B: Dix-Hallpike and Epley Maneuver

### Dix-Hallpike Test (Diagnostic for Posterior Canal BPPV)

**Procedure:**
1. Patient sitting upright on exam table
2. Turn head 45 degrees toward side being tested
3. Rapidly lower patient to supine with head hanging 20 degrees below table
4. Maintain position for 30-60 seconds observing for nystagmus
5. Return patient to sitting
6. Repeat on opposite side

**Positive Test (Posterior Canal BPPV):**
- Onset delay 2-5 seconds (latency)
- Upbeat + torsional nystagmus (top pole of eye toward down ear)
- Crescendo-decrescendo pattern
- Duration <60 seconds
- Fatigues with repetition
- Associated vertigo

**Concerning Findings (Suggests Central Cause):**
- No latency (immediate onset)
- Pure vertical or horizontal nystagmus
- Duration >60 seconds
- No fatigue with repetition
- No vertigo despite nystagmus

### Epley Maneuver (Treatment for Posterior Canal BPPV)

**Prerequisites:**
- Positive Dix-Hallpike test
- Identify affected side

**Procedure (for RIGHT posterior canal):**
1. **Position 1:** Dix-Hallpike position (head turned 45° right, head hanging) - hold 30-60 seconds
2. **Position 2:** Turn head 90° to left (now looking 45° left) - hold 30-60 seconds
3. **Position 3:** Roll body to left, head pointing down 45° to floor - hold 30-60 seconds
4. **Position 4:** Sit up slowly, head still turned left
5. Turn head to center

**For LEFT posterior canal:** Reverse all directions

**Success Rate:** 80% single treatment; 90% with repeat maneuvers

**Post-Procedure Instructions (Controversial):**
- Traditional: Sleep propped up 45°, avoid affected side for 24-48 hours
- Current evidence: Post-treatment restrictions may not be necessary
- Common practice: Avoid provocative positions for 24 hours

## APPENDIX C: Supine Roll Test and BBQ Roll Maneuver

### Supine Roll Test (Diagnostic for Horizontal Canal BPPV)

**Procedure:**
1. Patient supine with head neutral
2. Rapidly turn head 90° to one side, observe for nystagmus (30-60 seconds)
3. Return head to neutral
4. Rapidly turn head 90° to opposite side, observe for nystagmus

**Interpretation:**

| Type | Nystagmus Direction | Affected Side |
|------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Geotropic** (toward ground) | Beats toward ground on both sides; STRONGER side is affected | Side with MORE intense nystagmus |
| **Apogeotropic** (away from ground) | Beats away from ground on both sides; WEAKER side is affected | Side with LESS intense nystagmus |

### Lempert (BBQ Roll) Maneuver (Treatment for Horizontal Canal BPPV)

**For Geotropic Horizontal Canal BPPV:**

1. Patient supine, head turned toward AFFECTED ear
2. Roll head 90° toward UNAFFECTED side (now facing up) - hold 30-60 seconds
3. Roll head another 90° (now facing unaffected side) - hold 30-60 seconds
4. Roll body to prone, head turned 90° (nose toward floor) - hold 30-60 seconds
5. Continue rolling 90° toward unaffected side - hold 30-60 seconds
6. Sit up slowly

**Total rotation:** 360° away from affected ear

**For Apogeotropic variant:** May need modified approach or Gufoni maneuver
