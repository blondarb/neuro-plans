# Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD) / Corticobasal Syndrome (CBS)

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** February 11, 2026
**REVISED:** February 11, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD) / Corticobasal Syndrome (CBS)

**ICD-10:** G31.85 (Corticobasal degeneration)

**CPT CODES:** 85025 (CBC), 80053 (CMP), 84443 (TSH), 82607 (Vitamin B12), 83036 (HbA1c), 70553 (MRI brain with/without contrast), 78816 (PET/CT brain), 78608 (FDG-PET brain), 95816 (EEG), 95907-95913 (NCS), 95860-95870 (EMG), 96116 (Neuropsychological testing)

**SYNONYMS:** corticobasal degeneration, CBD, corticobasal syndrome, CBS, corticobasal ganglionic degeneration, CBGD, asymmetric cortical degeneration, alien limb syndrome, cortical-basal ganglionic degeneration

**SCOPE:** Evaluation and symptomatic management of corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and pathologically confirmed corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Covers diagnostic criteria (Armstrong 2013), distinguishing CBS from other underlying pathologies presenting as CBS (AD, PSP, FTD), and symptomatic treatment of rigidity, myoclonus, dystonia, limb apraxia, and behavioral/cognitive symptoms. Excludes other parkinsonian syndromes as primary diagnosis but includes them in differential.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Corticobasal syndrome (CBS):** A clinical phenotype characterized by asymmetric rigidity, limb apraxia, cortical sensory loss, alien limb phenomenon, and myoclonus; may be caused by CBD pathology or other pathologies (AD, PSP, FTD, CJD)
- **Corticobasal degeneration (CBD):** A pathological diagnosis; 4-repeat (4R) tauopathy with achromatic ballooned neurons, astrocytic plaques, and thread-like tau deposits in cortex and basal ganglia
- **Alien limb phenomenon:** Involuntary, purposeful-appearing movements of a limb that the patient perceives as foreign or uncontrollable
- **Limb apraxia:** Inability to perform skilled purposeful movements despite intact motor, sensory, and coordination function; ideomotor and ideational apraxia are common in CBS
- **Cortical sensory loss:** Impaired two-point discrimination, graphesthesia, or stereognosis with intact primary sensation
- **Armstrong criteria (2013):** Current consensus diagnostic criteria for CBS and probable CBD

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) | Vertical gaze palsy; symmetric parkinsonism; early postural instability and falls; axial > limb rigidity | MRI (midbrain atrophy — "hummingbird sign"); clinical features (vertical gaze palsy, falls); symmetric presentation |
| Alzheimer disease presenting as CBS (AD-CBS) | CBS presentation but underlying AD pathology (~25% of CBS cases); may be more symmetric; memory impairment may be more prominent | Amyloid PET (positive in AD-CBS); CSF biomarkers (low Aβ42, high p-tau); clinical course |

| Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) | Rapidly progressive (weeks to months); myoclonus; periodic sharp waves on EEG; DWI restriction on MRI; CBS is a rare CJD presentation | MRI DWI (cortical ribboning); EEG (periodic complexes); CSF 14-3-3, RT-QuIC; rapid progression distinguishes |
| Parkinson disease | Asymmetric but resting tremor prominent; good levodopa response; no cortical signs (apraxia, alien limb); slower progression | DaTscan (both abnormal); levodopa trial (PD responds well, CBS poorly); clinical features (tremor vs rigidity/apraxia) |
| Multiple system atrophy (MSA) | Cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C) or parkinsonism (MSA-P); autonomic failure; symmetric; no alien limb or apraxia | MRI (hot cross bun, putaminal changes); autonomic testing; symmetric presentation |
| Lewy body dementia | Fluctuating cognition; visual hallucinations; REM sleep behavior disorder; parkinsonism; levodopa-responsive | Clinical features (hallucinations, fluctuations, RBD); DaTscan; levodopa response |
| Functional movement disorder | May mimic CBS; inconsistent; distractible; positive functional signs (Hoover); onset may be abrupt | Clinical exam (inconsistency, distractibility, positive functional signs); normal imaging; psychiatric comorbidity |

## NOTES

- CBS is a CLINICAL syndrome; CBD is a PATHOLOGICAL diagnosis — they do not always correspond; only ~50% of CBS patients have CBD pathology at autopsy
- Other pathologies that cause CBS: Alzheimer disease (~25%), PSP, FTD (especially GRN mutations), CJD (rare)
- Mean age of onset is 60-70 years; median survival 6-8 years from symptom onset
- No disease-modifying therapy exists; all treatment is symptomatic and supportive
- Levodopa trial is recommended even though response is usually poor (<25% respond); adequate trial = 1000 mg levodopa daily for ≥2 months
- Myoclonus is often the most disabling treatable symptom; cortical myoclonus responds to clonazepam > levetiracetam > valproic acid
- Alien limb phenomenon, while characteristic, occurs in only ~30-50% of CBS patients
- Asymmetric cortical atrophy on MRI (parietal > frontal, contralateral to affected side) and asymmetric frontoparietal hypometabolism on FDG-PET are highly supportive
- Amyloid PET is increasingly used to identify AD pathology underlying CBS, which may have implications for emerging AD therapies
- Early palliative care and advance care planning are essential given the progressive nature and limited treatment options
- Caregiver burden is high; proactive social support and respite care should be arranged early
