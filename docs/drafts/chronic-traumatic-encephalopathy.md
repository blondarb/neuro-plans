# Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** February 11, 2026
**REVISED:** February 11, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) / Traumatic Encephalopathy Syndrome (TES)

**ICD-10:** G31.89 (Other specified degenerative diseases of nervous system), F02.80 (Dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere, without behavioral disturbance), F02.81 (Dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere, with behavioral disturbance), G31.9 (Degenerative disease of nervous system, unspecified), F07.81 (Postconcussional syndrome), R41.3 (Other amnesia), R41.840 (Attention and concentration deficit), F34.1 (Dysthymic disorder), F31.9 (Bipolar disorder, unspecified), G20 (Parkinson disease)

**SCOPE:** Clinical evaluation and management of suspected chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES), including application of 2023 NINDS consensus diagnostic criteria, biomarker evaluation (CSF, PET, MRI), differentiation from other neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies), symptomatic management of cognitive, behavioral, mood, and motor symptoms, and longitudinal monitoring. Definitive CTE diagnosis requires neuropathological confirmation — this plan addresses the clinical syndrome (TES) as defined by the 2021 NINDS/NIBIB consensus criteria. Applicable across ED (acute behavioral crisis, falls), Hospital (inpatient evaluation, behavioral management), Outpatient (primary diagnostic and management setting), and ICU (severe behavioral disturbance, aspiration, status epilepticus). Excludes acute concussion management, post-concussion syndrome (see separate plan), and pediatric populations.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**

- **Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE):** A progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with repetitive head impacts (RHI), confirmed only by neuropathological examination showing perivascular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) at the depths of cortical sulci
- **Traumatic Encephalopathy Syndrome (TES):** The clinical syndrome of CTE in living patients; proposed diagnostic criteria require: (1) substantial RHI exposure, (2) progressive cognitive, behavioral, or mood decline, (3) not fully accounted for by other conditions
- **Repetitive Head Impacts (RHI):** Cumulative subconcussive and concussive head trauma, typically from contact/collision sports (football, boxing, hockey, soccer), military blast exposure, or domestic violence
- **NINDS Consensus Criteria (2021):** Research diagnostic framework for TES requiring exposure history, core clinical features (cognitive impairment and/or neurobehavioral dysregulation), progressive course, and exclusion of other etiologies
- **p-tau:** Hyperphosphorylated tau protein; the pathological hallmark of CTE deposited at sulcal depths, distinguishable from Alzheimer tau pattern
- **Neurobehavioral Dysregulation:** A core TES feature including explosivity, impulsivity, emotional lability, violence, and apathy disproportionate to cognitive decline

## NOTES

- **Definitive CTE diagnosis requires neuropathological examination** — the perivascular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau at cortical sulcal depths is the pathognomonic lesion; this plan addresses the clinical syndrome (TES) in living patients
- **Traumatic Encephalopathy Syndrome (TES)** is the current preferred clinical term for suspected CTE in living patients per 2021 NINDS consensus criteria
- TES diagnosis requires: (1) substantial repetitive head impact exposure, (2) core clinical features (cognitive impairment AND/OR neurobehavioral dysregulation), (3) progressive course, (4) not fully accounted for by another condition
- **Cognitive profile in CTE/TES** typically shows executive dysfunction and retrieval-based memory impairment (unlike encoding deficit pattern of AD), with relative preservation of visuospatial function early
- **Behavioral features** (aggression, impulsivity, emotional lability, apathy) may precede or dominate cognitive decline and are a distinguishing feature from AD
- **Suicide risk is elevated** in individuals with suspected CTE; screen at every visit with C-SSRS; secure firearms and weapons
- **No disease-modifying therapy exists** for CTE; treatment is symptomatic and supportive
- **Avoid chronic benzodiazepine use** — worsens cognitive impairment, increases fall risk, and may exacerbate behavioral disinhibition
- **Antipsychotic use in elderly with dementia carries FDA black box warning** for increased mortality; use lowest dose for shortest duration; document rationale
- **Avoid topiramate as first-line headache prevention in CTE** due to cognitive side effects that may worsen already impaired cognition
- **Parkinsonian features** occur in a subset of CTE patients (CTE with motor features); may partially respond to levodopa but typically less robustly than idiopathic PD
- **Cavum septum pellucidum** on MRI is a supportive (not diagnostic) finding; present in some CTE cases but also in normal population and boxers without CTE
- **Repetitive head impact exposure assessment** should include years of contact sport participation, number of concussions, military blast exposure, and domestic violence history
- **Caregiver burden is substantial** in CTE/TES due to behavioral symptoms (aggression, impulsivity); proactive caregiver support is essential
- The field is evolving rapidly; in vivo biomarkers (tau PET, plasma p-tau 217) are under active investigation and may enable future antemortem diagnosis
- **Multidisciplinary approach** (neurology, neuropsychiatry, neuropsychology, PT, OT, SLP, social work, palliative care) yields best outcomes

## APPENDIX A: NINDS/NIBIB TES Diagnostic Criteria Summary (2021)

### Required Criteria (All Must Be Met)

1. **Substantial exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI)**
   - Contact/collision sports: minimum 5 years of organized play at high school level or above
   - Military: combat exposure with blast or blunt force head trauma
   - Other: documented history of repetitive head impacts (domestic violence, head-banging)

2. **Core clinical features (one or both)**
   - **Cognitive:** Episodic memory impairment AND/OR executive dysfunction (confirmed by informant and/or neuropsychological testing)
   - **Neurobehavioral dysregulation:** Explosivity, impulsivity, rage, violent behavior, emotional lability, apathy (disproportionate to cognitive impairment)

3. **Progressive course** over minimum 12 months (not static or improving)

4. **Not fully accounted for** by another neurological, psychiatric, or medical condition

### Supportive Features (Not Required)

- Delayed onset of symptoms (years to decades after RHI exposure)
- Motor features (parkinsonism, gait impairment, dysarthria)
- Psychiatric features (depression, suicidality, substance use, paranoia)
- Cavum septum pellucidum on neuroimaging
- Disproportionate brain atrophy for age on neuroimaging

### Diagnostic Confidence Levels

| Level | Requirements |
|-------|-------------|
| **Suggested TES** | Meets all required criteria; may have limited RHI documentation |
| **Possible TES** | Meets required criteria with one supportive feature |
| **Probable TES** | Meets required criteria with two or more supportive features and/or positive biomarkers |

## APPENDIX B: Repetitive Head Impact Exposure Assessment Tool

### Structured Interview Questions

1. **Contact sport history:** Sport type, position, age at first exposure, years of participation, level of play (recreational, high school, collegiate, professional)
2. **Concussion history:** Number of diagnosed concussions, loss of consciousness events, amnesia events, "bell ringer" or "seeing stars" episodes
3. **Military history:** Combat deployments, blast exposure, vehicle-borne IED exposure, breach training, number of exposures
4. **Other RHI sources:** Domestic violence, occupational head impacts (construction, law enforcement), self-injurious behavior
5. **Cumulative exposure estimate:** Total years of exposure, intensity level, protective equipment use

### Exposure Severity Stratification

| Category | Examples | Estimated Cumulative Dose |
|----------|----------|--------------------------|
| **High** | NFL/professional football lineman (>10 years), professional boxing (>5 years), military special forces with blast exposure | Thousands of subconcussive impacts |
| **Moderate** | Collegiate contact sport (4+ years), amateur boxing, professional soccer (heading), military combat veterans | Hundreds to thousands of impacts |
| **Lower** | High school contact sport only, recreational rugby/hockey, single military deployment | Tens to hundreds of impacts |
