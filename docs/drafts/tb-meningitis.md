### LUMBAR PUNCTURE

**Indication:** Diagnostic — ALL patients with suspected TB meningitis. LP is the single most important diagnostic procedure. Do NOT delay empiric anti-TB treatment for LP if clinical suspicion is high.

**Timing:** STAT in ED. Start empiric anti-TB therapy if LP will be significantly delayed (e.g., need for CT first, coagulopathy correction).

**Volume Required:** 15-20 mL (large volume improves sensitivity of AFB smear and culture; extra for TB PCR and ADA)

**Opening Pressure:** ALWAYS measure and document. Elevated in most TBM cases.

| Study | Rationale | Target Finding | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|-------|-----------|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Opening pressure | Elevated in 50-80% of TBM; monitor for hydrocephalus and ICP | Typically 100-300 mm H2O (mildly to moderately elevated); markedly elevated suggests hydrocephalus or mass effect | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Cell count with differential (tubes 1 and 4) (CPT 89051) | Lymphocytic pleocytosis is hallmark of TBM; early disease may show neutrophil predominance transitioning to lymphocytic over days | WBC 100-500 cells/uL (lymphocyte predominant, typically 60-90% lymphocytes); early cases may have neutrophil predominance; very low counts (<50) or very high (>1000) atypical | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Protein (CPT 84157) | Markedly elevated protein is characteristic of TBM (higher than viral, comparable to bacterial) | Elevated 100-500+ mg/dL (often >100; can exceed 500 in advanced cases with subarachnoid block) | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Glucose with paired serum glucose (CPT 82945) | Very low CSF glucose is characteristic (CSF:serum ratio <0.5); distinguishes from viral meningitis where glucose is normal | Low: <45 mg/dL or CSF:serum ratio <0.5 (often <0.3); glucose may be extremely low (<20 mg/dL) in advanced cases | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | STAT |
| Gram stain (CPT 87205) | Exclude bacterial meningitis; should be NEGATIVE in TB meningitis | No organisms (Gram stain does not detect mycobacteria) | STAT | ROUTINE | - | STAT |
| Bacterial culture and sensitivity (CPT 87070) | Exclude bacterial meningitis | No bacterial growth | STAT | ROUTINE | - | STAT |
| AFB smear (Ziehl-Neelsen stain) (CPT 87116) | Low sensitivity (10-20%) but highly specific if positive; larger CSF volume (>6 mL) and prolonged microscopy improve yield | AFB detected; negative does NOT rule out TBM (sensitivity only 10-20% on standard smear) | STAT | ROUTINE | - | STAT |
| CSF TB culture (Lowenstein-Jensen and liquid BACTEC) (CPT 87116) | GOLD STANDARD for diagnosis; sensitivity 50-80% but takes 2-6 weeks for growth; ALWAYS send regardless of smear result | Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth; provides drug susceptibility testing | STAT | ROUTINE | - | STAT |
| GeneXpert MTB/RIF (CSF) (CPT 87556) | Rapid molecular PCR — sensitivity 60-80% for TBM (lower than pulmonary TB); specificity >98%; also detects rifampin resistance; results in 2 hours | M. tuberculosis detected; rifampin susceptible; negative does NOT rule out TBM | STAT | ROUTINE | - | STAT |
| CSF adenosine deaminase (ADA) (CPT 86235) | Elevated ADA supports TB diagnosis; >8-10 U/L suggests TBM; sensitivity 70-90%, specificity 80-90%; less specific in HIV co-infection | Elevated: >8-10 U/L strongly supports TBM (some use cutoff >6 U/L); very high levels (>20) highly suggestive | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | STAT |
| CSF lactate (CPT 83605) | Elevated in TBM (>3.5 mmol/L); helps distinguish from viral meningitis | Elevated >3.5 mmol/L (similar to bacterial meningitis) | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | URGENT |
| BioFire FilmArray ME Panel (CPT 87483) | Rapid exclusion of common bacterial and viral pathogens; does NOT detect M. tuberculosis | Negative for other pathogens (positive for another pathogen suggests alternative diagnosis) | STAT | ROUTINE | - | STAT |
| Cryptococcal antigen (CSF) (CPT 87327) | Exclude cryptococcal meningitis (especially HIV co-infection, similar CSF profile) | Negative | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | URGENT |
| VDRL (CSF) (CPT 86592) | Exclude neurosyphilis (chronic meningitis differential) | Negative | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Cytology (CPT 88104) | Exclude leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (chronic meningitis with low glucose) | Negative for malignant cells | - | ROUTINE | - | - |
| Oligoclonal bands, IgG index (CPT 83916) | Intrathecal antibody production; may be positive in TBM but nonspecific | May be positive (nonspecific) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| AFB culture (repeat LP) | Repeat LP at 2-4 weeks if initial cultures negative but clinical suspicion remains high; larger volume (20+ mL) improves yield | M. tuberculosis growth | - | ROUTINE | - | ROUTINE |

**Special Handling:** Send LARGE volume (>6 mL) for AFB smear and culture — sensitivity improves with volume. Process CSF immediately for cell count. AFB cultures require Lowenstein-Jensen media and liquid culture (BACTEC MGIT); inform lab of TB suspicion. Store extra CSF frozen at -80 degrees C for future testing.

**Repeat LP Indications:** If initial TB studies negative but clinical suspicion high, repeat LP at 1-2 weeks with larger volume. Repeat LP also indicated for: monitoring treatment response (CSF parameters should improve over weeks), evaluating paradoxical worsening, and suspected treatment failure.

**Contraindications to LP (perform CT first):** Signs of elevated ICP (papilledema, GCS <10, focal deficits), known mass lesion, coagulopathy (INR >1.5, platelets <50K). Correct coagulopathy if possible but do NOT delay empiric anti-TB treatment.

## 3. TREATMENT

### CRITICAL: CLINICAL STAGING (BMRC Classification)

Treatment urgency and prognosis depend on BMRC stage at presentation:

| Stage | GCS | Clinical Features | Prognosis | Dexamethasone |
|-------|-----|-------------------|-----------|---------------|
| I | 15 | Alert and oriented; meningeal signs present; no focal deficits; no altered consciousness | Best prognosis; mortality 15-20% | Yes (reduces complications) |
| II | 11-14 | Confused or lethargy; focal neurologic deficits (cranial nerve palsies, hemiparesis); or GCS 11-14 | Intermediate; mortality 30-40% | Yes (greatest mortality benefit) |
| III | <11 | Comatose or stuporous; GCS <11; severe neurologic deficits; decerebrate/decorticate posturing | Poor prognosis; mortality 50-70% | Yes (reduces mortality) |

### 3A. Acute/Emergent — Anti-Tuberculous Therapy (RIPE + Pyridoxine)

**START EMPIRIC TREATMENT ON CLINICAL SUSPICION. Do NOT wait for culture confirmation (takes 2-6 weeks). The combination of subacute meningitis with CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis, low glucose, high protein, and risk factors (endemic area, HIV, exposure) warrants empiric treatment.**

## APPENDIX A: THWAITES DEXAMETHASONE PROTOCOL

**This protocol reduces mortality by approximately 30% in all BMRC stages. Start simultaneously with anti-TB therapy.**

### Intravenous Phase (Weeks 1-4)

| BMRC Stage | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Stage I (GCS 15) | 0.3 mg/kg/day IV | 0.3 mg/kg/day IV | 0.3 mg/kg/day IV | 0.3 mg/kg/day IV |
| Stage II (GCS 11-14) | 0.4 mg/kg/day IV | 0.4 mg/kg/day IV | 0.4 mg/kg/day IV | 0.4 mg/kg/day IV |
| Stage III (GCS <11) | 0.4 mg/kg/day IV | 0.4 mg/kg/day IV | 0.4 mg/kg/day IV | 0.4 mg/kg/day IV |

### Oral Taper Phase (Weeks 5-8)

| Week | Total Daily Dose (PO) | Notes |
|------|----------------------|-------|
| Week 5 | 4 mg/day PO | Convert to oral dexamethasone or equivalent prednisone |
| Week 6 | 3 mg/day PO | Gradual taper |
| Week 7 | 2 mg/day PO | Gradual taper |
| Week 8 | 1 mg/day PO then stop | Final taper and discontinue |

**Important Notes:**
- Divide IV dose into 2-4 doses daily (e.g., q6h or q12h)
- If rifampin reduces steroid effectiveness, some experts increase dexamethasone dose by 50%
- Monitor glucose closely during IV phase (steroid-induced hyperglycemia)
- Do NOT stop steroids abruptly (adrenal suppression risk)
- If paradoxical worsening occurs during taper, restart at higher dose and taper more slowly
- GI prophylaxis with PPI throughout steroid course

## APPENDIX B: HEPATOTOXICITY MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

**All four drugs in the RIPE regimen can cause hepatotoxicity. Pyrazinamide is most hepatotoxic, followed by isoniazid and rifampin. Ethambutol is rarely hepatotoxic.**

### When to Hold Medications

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| ALT >5x ULN without symptoms | HOLD INH, RIF, and PZA; continue EMB; recheck LFTs in 3-5 days |
| ALT >3x ULN WITH symptoms (nausea, vomiting, jaundice, RUQ pain) | HOLD INH, RIF, and PZA; continue EMB; recheck LFTs in 3-5 days |
| Clinical jaundice (bilirubin >3 mg/dL) | HOLD ALL hepatotoxic drugs immediately; hospitalize if outpatient |
| ALT <3x ULN without symptoms | Continue treatment; recheck LFTs in 1 week; monitor closely |

### Bridging Therapy While Hepatotoxic Drugs Held

Continue non-hepatotoxic agents to maintain bactericidal activity:
- Ethambutol 15-20 mg/kg PO daily (continue throughout)
- Levofloxacin 750-1000 mg PO daily (add as bridge)
- Consider streptomycin or amikacin if severe disease requires injectable

### Reintroduction Protocol (Sequential)

Once LFTs return to <2x ULN (or baseline):

| Step | Drug | Dose | Duration Before Adding Next |
|------|------|------|-----------------------------|
| 1 | Rifampin | Start at full dose (10 mg/kg) | Wait 1 week; recheck LFTs |
| 2 | Isoniazid | Start at full dose (5 mg/kg) | Wait 1 week; recheck LFTs |
| 3 | Pyrazinamide | Consider rechallenge at full dose (25 mg/kg) OR permanently discontinue PZA and extend treatment to 18 months | Monitor LFTs weekly x 2 weeks |

**If hepatotoxicity recurs during reintroduction:** The last drug added is likely the culprit. Discontinue that drug permanently. PZA is most commonly the offending agent and can be omitted if treatment is extended.

## APPENDIX C: TREATMENT DURATION GUIDANCE

| Scenario | Intensive Phase | Continuation Phase | Total Duration |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------|----|
| Standard TBM (drug-susceptible) | 2 months RIPE | 10 months INH + RIF | 12 months |
| Severe TBM (BMRC Stage III, slow responders) | 2 months RIPE | 10-16 months INH + RIF | 12-18 months |
| PZA discontinued (hepatotoxicity) | 2 months (without PZA: INH + RIF + EMB) | 16 months INH + RIF | 18 months |
| MDR-TBM (INH + RIF resistant) | Individualized (fluoroquinolone + linezolid + EMB + injectable) | Individualized | 18-24 months (minimum) |
| HIV co-infection | 2 months RIPE | 10 months INH + RIF | 12 months (minimum); some extend to 18 months |
