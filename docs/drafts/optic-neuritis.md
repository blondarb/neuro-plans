# Optic Neuritis

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 27, 2026
**REVISED:** January 27, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Optic Neuritis

**ICD-10:** H46.9 (Optic neuritis, unspecified); H46.00 (Optic papillitis, unspecified eye); H46.10 (Retrobulbar neuritis, unspecified eye); G36.0 (Neuromyelitis optica - if NMOSD confirmed)

**SYNONYMS:** Optic neuropathy (inflammatory), retrobulbar neuritis, papillitis, demyelinating optic neuropathy, acute optic neuritis

**SCOPE:** Acute evaluation and management of optic neuritis in adults. Covers typical demyelinating optic neuritis, atypical features requiring expanded workup, MS risk stratification, ONTT-based treatment, and NMO/MOG antibody evaluation. For established MS with optic neuritis as a relapse, can also use "MS - Exacerbation" template.

---

**PRIORITY KEY:** STAT = Immediate | URGENT = Within hours | ROUTINE = Standard | EXT = Extended/atypical cases | - = Not applicable to this setting

**CLINICAL PEARL:** The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) established that IV methylprednisolone accelerates visual recovery but does not change final visual outcome. Oral prednisone alone at standard doses (1 mg/kg/day) was associated with increased recurrence rate and should NOT be used as monotherapy. Most patients (90%+) recover vision to 20/40 or better within 1 year.

## 2. DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING & STUDIES

### 2A. Essential/First-line

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Timing | Target Finding | Contraindications |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| MRI orbits with contrast (fat-suppressed T1, STIR) | URGENT | URGENT | ROUTINE | - | Within 24-48h | Optic nerve enhancement, swelling; enhancement >50% nerve length suggests atypical/NMOSD | GFR <30, gadolinium allergy |

| MRI C-spine with and without contrast | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Within 1 week if MS suspected | Cord lesions supporting MS diagnosis | Same as above |

*MS protocol should include: 3D FLAIR, 3D T1 pre/post-contrast, T2, DWI. For orbits: fat-suppressed T1 post-contrast, STIR/T2 coronal.*

### 2B. Extended

| Study | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU | Timing | Target Finding | Contraindications |
|-------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|--------|----------------|-------------------|

| Protein | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | Elevated in inflammation | Normal to mildly elevated (<100 mg/dL) |
| Glucose with serum glucose | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | Low in infection | Normal (>60% serum) |
| Gram stain and culture | URGENT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | Rule out infection | No organisms |
| Oligoclonal bands (CSF AND serum) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | Intrathecal IgG synthesis (supports MS) | ≥2 CSF-specific bands (not in serum) |

**Special Handling:** OCBs stable at 4°C for days; send paired serum.

**Contraindications:** Elevated ICP without imaging, coagulopathy (INR >1.5, platelets <50K), skin infection at LP site

### 4B. Patient Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Vision typically improves over 2-4 weeks; 90%+ recover to 20/40 or better within 1 year | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Return immediately if vision worsening after initial improvement (may indicate new attack or alternate diagnosis) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Return if new symptoms: weakness, numbness, imbalance, bladder problems (may indicate MS) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Do not drive if vision in affected eye prevents safe driving; check with state DMV regarding vision requirements | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

| Expect temporary steroid side effects: insomnia, mood changes, increased appetite, metallic taste during IV infusion | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| Do not stop oral prednisone abruptly if on taper (adrenal suppression risk) | - | ✓ | ✓ |

|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|
| Smoking cessation - smoking increases MS conversion risk and worsens outcomes | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Vitamin D supplementation 2000-5000 IU daily (target serum 25-OH vitamin D >40 ng/mL) - low levels associated with MS risk | - | ✓ | ✓ |
| Avoid prolonged heat exposure (hot tubs, saunas, exercising in heat) which can temporarily worsen vision (Uhthoff) | - | ✓ | ✓ |
| Use sunglasses if photophobia present | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Regular aerobic exercise as tolerated once acute symptoms resolve | - | - | ✓ |
| Adequate sleep (7-8 hours nightly) and stress management | - | ✓ | ✓ |

|---------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Age** | 20-45 years | <15 or >50 years |
| **Pain** | Present, mild-moderate, worse with eye movement | Absent OR severe |
| **Vision loss severity** | Mild-moderate (usually >20/200) | Severe (<20/200 or NLP) |
| **Laterality** | Unilateral | Bilateral simultaneous |
| **Disc appearance** | Normal (retrobulbar) or mild edema | Marked disc edema, hemorrhages |
| **MRI optic nerve** | Short segment enhancement | Longitudinally extensive (>50% nerve length) or posterior involvement to chiasm |
| **Recovery** | Good (>90% to 20/40) | Poor or incomplete |
| **Steroid response** | Responds then relapses off steroids | Highly steroid-dependent or refractory |
| **Brain MRI** | White matter lesions (MS pattern) | Normal or atypical lesion pattern |

**If ANY atypical features present:** Order AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG testing (Mayo CDS1 Panel preferred)

## APPENDIX B: MS Risk Stratification Based on Brain MRI

| Brain MRI Finding | 5-Year MS Risk | 15-Year MS Risk | Recommendation |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Normal (no lesions) | ~16% | ~25% | Close clinical follow-up; MRI at 3-6 months then annually x 5 years |
| 1-2 lesions | ~37% | ~50% | MS specialist referral; consider early DMT discussion |
| ≥3 lesions | ~51% | ~78% | MS specialist referral; strongly consider DMT if McDonald criteria met |
