## APPENDIX A: NIA-AA Diagnostic Framework (2018)

### ATN Classification System

The NIA-AA research framework uses biomarkers to define AD biologically:

| Biomarker | Category | Method |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **A** (Amyloid) | CSF Aβ42 low, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio low, OR amyloid PET positive | CSF assay or PET |
| **T** (Tau) | CSF p-tau elevated OR tau PET positive | CSF assay or PET |
| **N** (Neurodegeneration) | CSF t-tau elevated, FDG-PET hypometabolism, OR MRI atrophy | CSF, PET, or MRI |

### Clinical Staging

| Stage | Biomarkers | Cognition | Function |
|-------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Preclinical AD | A+ (with or without T+, N+) | Normal | Normal |
| MCI due to AD | A+ T+ (N variable) | Impaired (1-1.5 SD below mean) | Preserved |
| Mild AD dementia | A+ T+ N+ | Impaired | Mild functional decline |
| Moderate AD dementia | A+ T+ N+ | Moderate impairment | Needs assistance with ADLs |
| Severe AD dementia | A+ T+ N+ | Severe impairment | Dependent for basic ADLs |

## APPENDIX B: Anti-Amyloid Therapy Eligibility Checklist

### Lecanemab (Leqembi) Eligibility

**Inclusion Criteria:**
- [ ] MCI or mild AD dementia (MMSE typically 22-30)
- [ ] Amyloid-positive (PET or CSF biomarkers)
- [ ] Age typically 50-90 (clinical trial range)
- [ ] Stable cardiac, renal, hepatic function
- [ ] Able to complete MRI monitoring schedule

**Exclusion Criteria:**
- [ ] >4 microbleeds on MRI
- [ ] Superficial siderosis
- [ ] Macrohemorrhage history
- [ ] Concurrent anticoagulation (relative; discuss risk)
- [ ] Uncontrolled hypertension
- [ ] Moderate-severe AD dementia

**Pre-Treatment Workup:**
- [ ] Amyloid PET OR CSF biomarkers confirming A+
- [ ] MRI Brain with SWI/GRE (microbleed count)
- [ ] APOE genotyping (risk stratification, not required)
- [ ] CBC, BMP, LFTs
- [ ] Detailed informed consent (ARIA risk discussion)

### ARIA Monitoring Schedule (Lecanemab)

| Timepoint | MRI Required | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Baseline | Yes | Document microbleeds, WM changes |
| Week 7 | Yes | Early ARIA detection |
| Week 14 | Yes | Before dose continuation |
| Week 52 | Yes | Annual monitoring |
| Week 78 | Yes | Continued monitoring |
| As needed | Yes | If symptoms suggestive of ARIA |

## APPENDIX C: ARIA Management Algorithm

### ARIA-E (Edema)

```
ARIA-E Detected on MRI
           │
           ▼
    Symptomatic?
    ┌───────┴───────┐
   YES             NO
    │               │
    ▼               ▼
HOLD infusion    HOLD infusion
Reassess weekly  Repeat MRI in 4 weeks
    │               │
    ▼               ▼
If resolved AND   If resolved →
asymptomatic →    Resume therapy
Resume therapy
```

### ARIA-H (Hemorrhage - New Microbleeds)

| New Microbleeds | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| 1-4 new | Consider continuing with close monitoring |
| 5-9 new | Hold; repeat MRI in 4 weeks |
| >9 new or macrohemorrhage | Discontinue permanently |

## APPENDIX D: Driving Assessment in Alzheimer's Disease

### Red Flags Requiring Immediate Driving Cessation

- Getting lost in familiar areas
- Involvement in at-fault accidents
- Traffic violations
- Impaired visuospatial skills (clock drawing failure)
- CDR ≥1 (mild dementia)

### Assessment Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating) | CDR ≥1 suggests high-risk driver |
| Trail Making Test B | >180 seconds suggests impaired executive function |
| Clock Drawing Test | Errors suggest visuospatial impairment |
| MMSE/MoCA | Not sufficient alone for driving decisions |
| On-road driving evaluation | Gold standard; refer to OT driving specialist |

### Documentation Requirements

- Document driving discussion at each visit
- Note patient and family concerns
- Record any incidents or near-misses
- Follow state reporting requirements (varies by jurisdiction)
- Provide written recommendation if cessation advised
