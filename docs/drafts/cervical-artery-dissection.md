## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Atherosclerotic carotid/vertebral stenosis | Older patient; vascular risk factors (HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, smoking); calcified plaque on imaging; gradual onset; no neck pain | CTA/MRA (calcified plaque vs. intimal flap/hematoma); MRI fat-sat (no intramural hematoma) |
| Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) | Young-middle aged women; "string-of-beads" appearance on angiography; may coexist with dissection; renal artery involvement | CTA/MRA (string-of-beads vs. smooth tapering); renal artery imaging; FMD can cause dissection |
| Carotid web (atypical FMD) | Shelf-like projection in posterior carotid bulb; recurrent stroke in young patients; no neck pain or Horner syndrome | CTA sagittal reformats (shelf lesion); DSA |
| Vasculitis (CNS or systemic) | Multifocal stenoses; constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, arthralgias); elevated ESR/CRP; multi-territory strokes | ESR, CRP, ANA, ANCA; vessel wall MRI (concentric enhancement vs. eccentric in dissection); possible brain/meningeal biopsy |
| Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) | Thunderclap headache; multifocal segmental vasoconstriction; triggered by vasoactive drugs, postpartum; spontaneous resolution | CTA/MRA (diffuse segmental narrowing vs. focal dissection); serial imaging showing resolution at 12 weeks |
| Intracranial aneurysm (unruptured or ruptured) | Acute headache (worst headache if rupture); focal mass effect; SAH on CT | CT head (SAH); CTA (saccular aneurysm vs. dissecting pseudoaneurysm); LP |
| Migraine with aura | Episodic; visual or sensory aura preceding headache; family history; stereotyped attacks; young patient | Clinical history (recurrent stereotyped episodes); normal MRI DWI (no infarct); dissection can mimic migraine |
| Cluster headache | Periorbital pain with autonomic features (tearing, conjunctival injection, rhinorrhea, partial Horner); episodic pattern | Clinical pattern (brief attacks in clusters); Horner syndrome in cluster is transient; CTA/MRA to exclude dissection if first presentation |
| Cardioembolic stroke (atrial fibrillation, PFO) | Irregular rhythm; multiple vascular territory infarcts; no neck pain or local signs | ECG/telemetry (AF); TTE/TEE (PFO, thrombus); CTA neck (normal vessels, no dissection) |
| Venous sinus thrombosis | Headache, papilledema, seizures; may have focal deficits; hypercoagulable state; postpartum | CT/MR venography (venous thrombosis); CTA arterial phase normal |
| Carotidynia (TIPIC syndrome) | Self-limited neck pain and tenderness over carotid; no neurologic deficits; perivascular inflammation on imaging | Ultrasound/CTA (perivascular inflammation without intimal flap or intramural hematoma); self-resolves in 2 weeks |
| Neck musculoskeletal strain | Neck pain after trauma/exertion; no neurologic deficits; no Horner syndrome; normal vascular imaging | Clinical exam (muscular tenderness, full neuro exam normal); CTA/MRA if dissection concern |
