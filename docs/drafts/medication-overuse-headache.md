## APPENDIX C: Patient Education Handout Key Points

**What is Medication Overuse Headache?**

Medication overuse headache (MOH) happens when frequent use of headache medications actually causes more headaches. It is sometimes called "rebound headache." The brain becomes dependent on the medication and triggers headaches when the medication wears off.

**How did this happen?**

MOH can develop in anyone who uses acute headache medications too often:
- Pain relievers (Tylenol, Advil, Aleve) used ≥15 days/month
- Triptans (Imitrex, etc.) used ≥10 days/month
- Combination medications (Excedrin, Fioricet) used ≥10 days/month
- Opioids or butalbital used ≥10 days/month

**What to expect during withdrawal:**

- **Week 1-2:** Headaches may temporarily get WORSE. This is expected and necessary. You may also experience nausea, sleep problems, and anxiety.
