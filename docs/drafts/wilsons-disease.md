# Wilson's Disease

**VERSION:** 1.1
**CREATED:** January 30, 2026
**REVISED:** January 30, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Wilson's Disease (Hepatolenticular Degeneration)

**ICD-10:** E83.01 (Wilson's disease), E83.09 (Other disorders of copper metabolism), G25.5 (Other chorea — for movement disorder presentation), G25.2 (Other specified forms of tremor — for tremor-predominant presentation), F06.8 (Other specified mental disorders due to known physiological condition — psychiatric presentation)

**SYNONYMS:** Wilson disease, WD, hepatolenticular degeneration, progressive lenticular degeneration, Westphal-Strümpell pseudosclerosis, copper storage disease, ATP7B deficiency, hepatocerebral degeneration, Wilson's, copper overload disease, hepatolenticular syndrome, Kinnier Wilson disease

**SCOPE:** Diagnosis and management of Wilson's disease in adolescents and adults presenting with neurologic, hepatic, or psychiatric manifestations. Covers diagnostic workup (ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urine copper, slit-lamp exam, hepatic copper, genetic testing), chelation therapy (D-penicillamine, trientine), zinc maintenance therapy, liver transplant evaluation, symptomatic management of neurological symptoms (dystonia, tremor, parkinsonism, psychiatric), and family screening. Excludes other copper metabolism disorders (Menkes disease), isolated non-Wilson hepatic cirrhosis, and drug-induced movement disorders.

---

**DEFINITIONS:**
- **Wilson's Disease (WD):** Autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene (chromosome 13q14.3), resulting in defective copper excretion into bile and incorporation into ceruloplasmin, leading to toxic copper accumulation in liver, brain, cornea, kidneys, and other organs
- **Kayser-Fleischer (KF) Rings:** Golden-brown deposits of copper in the Descemet membrane of the cornea; detected by slit-lamp exam; present in >95% of neurologic WD and ~50% of hepatic-only WD
- **Wing-Beating Tremor:** Coarse, irregular, proximal tremor elicited with arms outstretched and elbows flexed; characteristic (though not pathognomonic) of WD
- **Ceruloplasmin:** Copper-carrying glycoprotein synthesized in the liver; typically low (<20 mg/dL) in WD but can be normal in 5-15% of neurologic WD
- **Free (Non-ceruloplasmin-bound) Copper:** Calculated as total serum copper minus ceruloplasmin-bound copper; elevated in WD (>25 mcg/dL)
- **Leipzig Score:** Diagnostic scoring system for WD incorporating KF rings, neurologic symptoms, ceruloplasmin, Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, hepatic copper, urinary copper, and mutation analysis (score ≥4 = established diagnosis)

---

**KEY CLINICAL FEATURES:**

**Neurologic Manifestations (40-50% of presentations):**
- **Movement disorders:** Dystonia (most common neurologic feature), tremor (resting, postural, wing-beating), parkinsonism, choreoathetosis, athetosis
- **Bulbar symptoms:** Dysarthria (most common initial neurologic symptom), dysphagia, drooling, dysphonia
- **Gait disturbance:** Ataxia, postural instability
- **Other:** Seizures (rare, 6%), risus sardonicus (fixed grin from facial dystonia)

**Hepatic Manifestations (40-50% of presentations):**
- Asymptomatic transaminase elevation
- Chronic hepatitis
- Cirrhosis (compensated or decompensated)
- Fulminant hepatic failure (with Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia)

**Psychiatric Manifestations (30-40%, often earliest):**
- Depression, anxiety
- Personality change, irritability
- Psychosis (rare)
- Cognitive decline, declining school/work performance
- Behavioral disinhibition

**Other Manifestations:**
- Ophthalmologic: KF rings, sunflower cataracts
- Hematologic: Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia
- Renal: Fanconi syndrome, renal tubular acidosis, nephrolithiasis
- Musculoskeletal: Osteoporosis, arthropathy
- Cardiac: Cardiomyopathy (rare)

### 4B. Patient/Family Instructions

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Wilson's disease is a lifelong condition requiring CONTINUOUS treatment — never stop chelation or zinc without physician guidance | - | STAT | ROUTINE | - |
| Take chelation medication (penicillamine or trientine) on an EMPTY STOMACH — 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| If taking zinc, separate from chelator by at least 2 hours; take zinc between meals | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Return to ED if: worsening jaundice, confusion, vomiting blood, black stools, new neurologic symptoms, worsening speech or swallowing, severe abdominal pain | STAT | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Report ANY new neurologic symptoms during the first 2-3 months of chelation (worsening is possible and requires dose adjustment) | - | STAT | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid HIGH-COPPER FOODS during initial treatment: liver/organ meats, shellfish (especially lobster, oysters), chocolate, mushrooms, nuts, dried fruits, soy products | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Avoid drinking water through copper pipes (consider water testing; use filter or bottled water if copper pipes present) | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Alcohol is STRICTLY prohibited — causes additional liver damage | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Women of childbearing age: pregnancy requires switching from chelator to zinc (chelators are teratogenic); discuss family planning with physician BEFORE conception | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| ALL first-degree relatives (siblings, children, parents) MUST be screened for Wilson's disease — siblings have 25% risk | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |
| Carry a medical alert card/bracelet indicating Wilson's disease and current medications | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - |

### 4C. Lifestyle & Prevention

| Recommendation | ED | HOSP | OPD | ICU |
|----------------|:--:|:----:|:---:|:---:|

| Serum free (non-ceruloplasmin-bound) copper | - | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT | q3-6 months | <15 mcg/dL on treatment; negative values suggest over-treatment | Reduce chelator if over-treated; increase if still elevated |
| LFTs (AST, ALT, bilirubin, albumin) | STAT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT | Monthly x6 months, then q3-6 months | Normalizing or stable | If worsening on treatment: assess compliance, consider dose adjustment, transplant evaluation |

| 24-hour urine zinc | - | - | ROUTINE | - | q6-12 months | >2 mg/24h confirms compliance | Low suggests non-compliance |
| Neurologic exam (dystonia, tremor, speech, gait) | URGENT | STAT | ROUTINE | STAT | Each visit; monthly during initial chelation | Stable or improving; no new deficits | If WORSENING in first 2-3 months: reduce chelator dose, consider switch to trientine or add zinc; persistent worsening → transplant evaluation |
| Slit-lamp exam (KF rings) | - | STAT | ROUTINE | - | Annually on treatment | Gradual fading of KF rings (may take 3-5 years) | Persistence or reappearance suggests inadequate treatment or non-compliance |
| MRI brain | - | ROUTINE | ROUTINE | - | Baseline; repeat at 6-12 months; then annually x3 years if neurologic | Improving or stable signal abnormalities; resolving edema | Worsening lesions suggest inadequate treatment or chelation-induced worsening |

## NOTES

- Wilson's disease is a TREATABLE cause of liver failure and neurologic decline — early diagnosis is critical
- Consider WD in ANY patient <50 years with unexplained liver disease, movement disorder, or psychiatric illness
- Ceruloplasmin alone misses 5-15% of cases; always obtain 24-hour urine copper and slit-lamp exam
- The Leipzig Score integrates multiple tests for diagnostic certainty (score ≥4 = WD established)
- D-penicillamine is effective but causes neurologic WORSENING in 10-50% of patients during initial weeks; many experts now prefer trientine as first-line for neurologic WD
- Zinc monotherapy is too slow for symptomatic disease but is ideal for maintenance and presymptomatic patients
- NEVER stop chelation/zinc abruptly — can precipitate fulminant hepatic failure or neurologic crisis
- Avoid typical antipsychotics (haloperidol, etc.) — D2 blockade worsens dystonia and parkinsonism; use quetiapine or clozapine if antipsychotic needed
- Fulminant Wilson's disease: Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia + acute liver failure + low ALP + low ALP-to-bilirubin ratio is classic triad; requires urgent transplant evaluation
- All first-degree relatives MUST be screened; siblings have 25% risk of being affected
- Liver transplantation CURES the metabolic defect — post-transplant patients do not need chelation
- MRI brain may lag behind clinical improvement by months; initial worsening of MRI does not necessarily indicate treatment failure
- When using combined chelation + zinc therapy, separate zinc from chelator by ≥2 hours (zinc blocks chelator absorption if given together); some experts use chelator + zinc simultaneously for initial treatment of symptomatic WD
