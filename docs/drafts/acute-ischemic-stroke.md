# Acute Ischemic Stroke

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 21, 2026
**REVISED:** January 21, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Acute Ischemic Stroke

**ICD-10:** I63.9 (Cerebral infarction, unspecified); I63.50 (Cerebral infarction due to unspecified occlusion or stenosis of unspecified cerebral artery); I63.30 (Cerebral infarction due to thrombosis of unspecified cerebral artery); I63.40 (Cerebral infarction due to embolism of unspecified cerebral artery); G45.9 (Transient cerebral ischemic attack, unspecified)

**CLINICAL SYNONYMS:** Acute ischemic stroke, AIS, brain attack, cerebrovascular accident, CVA, cerebral infarction, embolic stroke, thrombotic stroke, lacunar stroke, large vessel occlusion, LVO, cryptogenic stroke, ESUS (embolic stroke of undetermined source)

**SCOPE:** Emergency evaluation and treatment of acute ischemic stroke, including thrombolysis decision-making, mechanical thrombectomy candidacy, acute stroke unit care, secondary prevention, and etiologic workup. For hemorrhagic stroke, TIA, or venous sinus thrombosis, use dedicated templates.

## 7. DISPOSITION CRITERIA

| Disposition | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| **Discharge home** | Minor stroke or TIA; able to ambulate safely or with minimal assistance; swallow intact; stable on oral medications; adequate home support; follow-up arranged within 1-2 weeks; compliant with secondary prevention |
| **Admit to stroke unit/floor** | Most acute ischemic strokes; requires monitoring, workup, rehabilitation assessment; stable vital signs; no respiratory compromise |
| **Admit to ICU** | Received tPA or thrombectomy (24h monitoring); large vessel occlusion; declining neurological exam; respiratory compromise; malignant edema risk; BP requiring IV infusion; arrhythmia requiring intervention |
| **Inpatient rehabilitation** | Significant functional deficits; able to participate in 3 hours therapy/day; medically stable; expected to benefit |
| **Skilled nursing facility** | Functional deficits; unable to tolerate intensive rehabilitation; needs skilled nursing care |
| **Long-term acute care (LTAC)** | Prolonged ventilator dependence; complex medical needs |
| **Transfer to comprehensive stroke center** | LVO needing thrombectomy not available locally; neurosurgical intervention needed; complex case |

## APPENDIX A: tPA Exclusion Criteria

### Absolute Contraindications (Standard 0-3 Hour Window)

| Contraindication | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| Intracranial hemorrhage | Any history or evidence on imaging |
| Subarachnoid hemorrhage | Clinical or imaging evidence |
| Recent intracranial/spinal surgery | Within 3 months |
| Recent serious head trauma | Within 3 months |
| Intracranial neoplasm | Excluding meningiomas |
| Arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm | If known |
| Active internal bleeding | Excluding menses |
| Bleeding diathesis | Platelets <100K, INR >1.7, PTT elevation, current anticoagulation with therapeutic levels |
| Blood pressure >185/110 mmHg | Despite antihypertensive treatment |
| Blood glucose <50 mg/dL | Hypoglycemia must be corrected first |

### Relative Contraindications (Require Risk-Benefit Assessment)

| Contraindication | Considerations |
|------------------|----------------|
| Minor or rapidly improving symptoms | May proceed if still disabling |
| Pregnancy | Consider if large vessel stroke with disabling deficits |
| Major surgery within 14 days | Assess surgical site bleeding risk |
| GI or urinary tract hemorrhage within 21 days | Risk assessment |
| Recent myocardial infarction | Within 3 months; consult cardiology |
| Seizure at onset with postictal residual | If true stroke suspected, may proceed |
| Arterial puncture at non-compressible site within 7 days | Risk assessment |
| Prior ischemic stroke within 3 months | Extended window (3-4.5 hours) relative |

### Extended Window (3-4.5 Hours) Additional Relative Contraindications

| Contraindication | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| Age >80 years | Now considered relative (may benefit) |
| NIHSS >25 | Very severe stroke |
| Oral anticoagulant use | Regardless of INR |
| History of both diabetes AND prior stroke | Historical exclusion; now relative |

---

## APPENDIX B: NIHSS Quick Reference

| Score | Severity | General Outcome |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 0 | No stroke symptoms | May still have significant deficits |
| 1-4 | Minor stroke | Often good outcome; DAPT candidate if ≤3 |
| 5-15 | Moderate stroke | Variable outcomes |
| 16-20 | Moderate-severe stroke | Often requires intensive rehabilitation |
| 21-42 | Severe stroke | High mortality and disability risk |
