# Multiple Sclerosis - Chronic Management

**VERSION:** 1.0
**CREATED:** January 27, 2026
**STATUS:** Draft - Pending Review

---

**DIAGNOSIS:** Multiple Sclerosis - Chronic Management

**ICD-10:** G35 (Multiple sclerosis)

**SYNONYMS:** MS maintenance, chronic MS, established MS, MS long-term care, relapsing-remitting MS maintenance, RRMS chronic, secondary progressive MS, SPMS, progressive MS management

**SCOPE:** Long-term management of established MS including disease-modifying therapy (DMT) monitoring, symptom management optimization, surveillance imaging, preventive care, and special populations (pregnancy planning). Excludes acute MS relapse (see "MS - Exacerbation") and initial diagnostic workup (see "MS - New Diagnosis"). Primary focus is outpatient management with guidance for ED/hospital presentation of established MS patients.

## 5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

*For established MS patients presenting with new symptoms, consider:*

| Alternative Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Tests to Differentiate |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| MS relapse vs pseudorelapse | True relapse: new neuroinflammation; Pseudorelapse: symptom worsening from infection, heat, stress without new inflammation | MRI with contrast (new enhancing lesions = true relapse); infection workup (UTI, URI) |
| Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) | Subacute cognitive/behavioral change, visual, motor symptoms; on natalizumab, DMF, fingolimod | MRI (subcortical non-enhancing lesions); CSF JCV PCR |
| CNS infection | Fever, meningeal signs, rapid deterioration; immunosuppressed | Lumbar puncture; blood cultures; imaging |
| Comorbid stroke/TIA | Sudden onset; vascular risk factors; non-MS territory | MRI DWI; vascular imaging |
| Medication side effect | Temporal relationship to new medication or dose change | Medication review; trial discontinuation |
| Functional neurological disorder | Inconsistent exam; non-anatomical patterns; psychiatric comorbidity | Clinical assessment; normal MRI |
| B12 deficiency myelopathy | Progressive; dorsal column signs; may coexist with MS | B12, MMA, homocysteine |
| Secondary malignancy | Progressive; atypical pattern; on immunosuppressive DMT | PET-CT; biopsy if indicated |

## APPENDIX B: PML Risk Stratification (Natalizumab)

| Risk Factor | PML Risk | Monitoring Recommendation |
|-------------|----------|---------------------------|
| JCV antibody NEGATIVE | Very low (<0.1 per 1000) | JCV q6 months; annual MRI |
| JCV antibody POSITIVE, index <0.9, no prior IS | Low (~0.5 per 1000) | JCV q6 months; MRI q6-12 months |
| JCV antibody POSITIVE, index 0.9-1.5, no prior IS | Moderate (~2 per 1000) | JCV q6 months; MRI q6 months; consider EID |
| JCV antibody POSITIVE, index >1.5, no prior IS | High (~5-6 per 1000) | JCV q6 months; MRI q3-6 months; consider DMT switch |
| JCV antibody POSITIVE + prior immunosuppression | Very high (~10+ per 1000) | Strong consideration for DMT switch |
| >24 months treatment duration | Increases risk | Factor into overall risk assessment |

**EID = Extended Interval Dosing** (q6 weeks instead of q4 weeks) - associated with ~90% reduction in PML risk

**PML Warning Signs:**
- Subtle cognitive changes, confusion
- Personality or behavioral changes
- Visual disturbances (homonymous hemianopia)
- Hemiparesis, ataxia
- New speech difficulties

*If PML suspected: STOP natalizumab immediately; STAT MRI brain; CSF JCV PCR; neurology consultation*
