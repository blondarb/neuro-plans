# Lumbar Puncture Reference Guide

## Purpose

This reference provides comprehensive CSF study recommendations organized by:
1. **Core studies** - Always order for any diagnostic LP
2. **Diagnosis-specific panels** - Tailored to clinical suspicion
3. **Advanced testing** - Newer molecular and genomic options
4. **Special procedures** - Therapeutic LPs (NPH, IIH)

---

## CORE STUDIES (Always Order)

These studies should be sent with **every diagnostic LP** to maximize yield from a single procedure.

| Study | Tube | Volume | Rationale | Normal Values |
|-------|------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Opening pressure | - | - | Elevated in IIH, meningitis, mass effect | 10-20 cm H2O |
| Cell count with differential | Tube 1 AND Tube 4 | 1-2 mL each | Tube 4 corrects for traumatic tap | WBC <5, RBC 0 |
| Protein | Tube 2 | 1 mL | Elevated in infection, GBS, tumor, inflammation | 15-45 mg/dL |
| Glucose | Tube 2 | 1 mL | Low in bacterial/fungal/carcinomatous meningitis | 50-80 mg/dL (>60% serum) |
| Gram stain | Tube 3 | 1 mL | Rapid bacterial identification | No organisms |
| Bacterial culture | Tube 3 | 2-3 mL | Gold standard for bacterial meningitis | No growth |

**CRITICAL:** Always send **serum glucose** at time of LP to calculate CSF:serum ratio.

**Tube order matters:** Tubes 1-4 should be collected and labeled sequentially. Cell count on both Tube 1 and Tube 4 helps distinguish traumatic tap (RBCs decrease tube 1Ã¢â€ â€™4) from true hemorrhage (RBCs stable).

| Study | Priority | Indication | Turnaround | Notes |
|-------|----------|------------|------------|-------|
| **BioFire FilmArray ME Panel** | URGENT | Suspected bacterial/viral/fungal meningitis | ~1 hour | 14 pathogens; 94% sensitivity, 99.8% specificity |
| HSV-1/2 PCR | URGENT | Encephalitis, temporal lobe involvement | 24-48h | Most common treatable cause of encephalitis |
| VZV PCR | URGENT | Zoster history, dermatomal symptoms | 24-48h | Can cause vasculopathy |
| Enterovirus PCR | URGENT | Summer/fall, aseptic meningitis | 24-48h | Most common viral meningitis |
| Cryptococcal antigen | URGENT | Immunocompromised, HIV | 1-2h | More sensitive than India ink |

| Fungal culture | ROUTINE | Immunocompromised, endemic areas | 4-6 weeks | Hold for extended incubation |

**BioFire FilmArray ME Panel Targets (14 pathogens):**

| Bacteria | Viruses | Yeast |
|----------|---------|-------|

### Multiple Sclerosis / Demyelinating Disease Panel

| Study | Priority | Indication | Target Finding |
|-------|----------|------------|----------------|

| IgG index | ROUTINE | Intrathecal antibody synthesis | >0.7 elevated |
| Myelin basic protein | ROUTINE | Acute demyelination | Elevated during relapse |
| CSF cytology | ROUTINE | Rule out lymphoma/carcinomatous | Negative |

### Autoimmune/Inflammatory Encephalitis Panel

| Study | Priority | Indication | Target Finding |
|-------|----------|------------|----------------|
| Autoimmune encephalitis panel (Mayo/Quest) | ROUTINE | Limbic encephalitis, new-onset seizures, psychiatric symptoms | Anti-NMDAR, LGI1, CASPR2, GABA-B, AMPA |
| Paraneoplastic panel | ROUTINE | Subacute onset, smoking, weight loss | Anti-Hu, Yo, CV2, amphiphysin, etc. |
| Cytology | ROUTINE | Rule out carcinomatous meningitis | Negative |

**Note:** Send **paired serum** for autoimmune panels - some antibodies better detected in serum vs CSF.

---

### Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Panel

| Study | Priority | Timing | Target Finding |
|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Cell count Tube 1 vs Tube 4 | STAT | Immediate | Stable RBCs = true SAH; decreasing = traumatic |
| Xanthochromia (visual + spectrophotometry) | STAT | Ã¢â€°Â¥6-12h from symptom onset | Yellow supernatant = prior hemorrhage |
| Bilirubin (CSF) | URGENT | Ã¢â€°Â¥12h from symptom onset | Elevated = hemoglobin breakdown |

**Timing critical:** Xanthochromia may not be present if LP done <6 hours from symptom onset. If initial CT and LP negative but high clinical suspicion, consider repeat LP at 12h or CTA.

---

### Guillain-BarrÃƒÂ© Syndrome Panel

| Study | Priority | Timing | Target Finding |
|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Protein | URGENT | May be normal in first week | Elevated (albuminocytologic dissociation) |
| Cell count | URGENT | Diagnosis | WBC <10 (if >50, reconsider diagnosis) |
| Glucose | ROUTINE | Rule out infection | Normal |
| Cytology | ROUTINE | Rule out carcinomatous | Negative |
| GQ1b antibody (serum) | ROUTINE | Miller Fisher variant | Positive |

**Note:** CSF protein may be **normal in first 1-2 weeks** of GBS. Clinical diagnosis may precede CSF abnormalities.

---

### Carcinomatous/Lymphomatous Meningitis Panel

| Study | Priority | Volume Needed | Target Finding |
|-------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Cytology | URGENT | 10-20 mL (large volume) | Malignant cells |
| Flow cytometry | URGENT | 5-10 mL | Clonal B or T cells |
| Protein | ROUTINE | Standard | Often markedly elevated |
| Glucose | ROUTINE | Standard | Often low |
| LDH | ROUTINE | Standard | Elevated |

**Volume matters:** Sensitivity of cytology increases with CSF volume. If first cytology negative and high suspicion, repeat LP with **large volume (10-20 mL)** and **rapid transport** (<1 hour to lab).

### Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (Therapeutic LP)

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Volume to remove** | 30-50 mL | Therapeutic trial |
| Opening pressure | <24 cm H2O (by definition) | Document precisely |
| Pre-LP gait assessment | Timed 10m walk, TUG test | Perform within 2h before LP |
| Post-LP gait assessment | Repeat at 1h, 2h, 24h, 72h | >20% improvement = positive |
| Core studies | Standard panel | Rule out other pathology |

**Positive response:** Ã¢â€°Â¥20% improvement in gait speed or Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) suggests shunt-responsive NPH.

---

### Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) - Therapeutic LP

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Opening pressure | >25 cm H2O | Diagnostic criterion |
| Volume to remove | Until OP <20 cm H2O | Therapeutic goal |
